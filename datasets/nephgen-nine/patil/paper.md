Choline has important physiological functions as a precursor for essential cell components, signaling molecules, phospholipids, and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Choline is a water-soluble charged molecule requiring transport proteins to cross biological membranes. Although transporters continue to be identi /uniFB01 ed, membrane transport of choline is incompletely understood and knowledge about choline transport into intracellular organelles such as mitochondria remains limited. Here we show that SLC25A48 imports choline into human mitochondria. Human loss-of-function mutations in SLC25A48 show impaired choline transport into mitochondria and are associated with elevated urine and plasma choline levels. Thus, our studies may have implications for understanding and treating conditions related to choline metabolism.

This study uncovers the function of a human protein called solute carrier SLC25A48 by showing that it acts as a membrane transporter for choline. Choline has important physiological functions as a building block for essential cell components and signaling molecules. Choline is a water-soluble charged molecule and, therefore, requires transport proteins to cross biological membranes. How it gets into cellular compartments, like mitochondria, has been poorly understood. This study shows that SLC25A48 transports choline into mitochondria. Mutations in SLC25A48 disrupt choline transport into mitochondria, leading to higher levels of choline in urine and blood in humans. These /uniFB01 ndings shed light on how choline is handled within cells and could have implications for understanding and treating conditions related to choline metabolism.

M embrane transport proteins play a crucial role in the movement of ions and metabolites across biological membranes. Their proper functioning is essential for many physiological processes. Despite signi /uniFB01 cant progress in our understanding of these proteins, a substantial number of them remain uncharacterized, often referred to as orphan membrane transport proteins. 1 Deorphanization efforts are essential to unveil the hidden cellular functions and roles of these proteins in health and disease. Recent large-scale genomewide association studies of metabolite levels provide links between common genetic variants in membrane transporterencoding genes and metabolite levels. 2,3 This generates testable hypotheses to identify the physiological substrates of established and orphan human transport proteins in vivo .

Choline is an essential nutrient with important roles in a variety of physiological processes and metabolic pathways. It is an essential component of phospholipids in cell membranes, such as phosphatidylcholines, a precursor of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and of the osmoregulatory betaine, and an important player in lipid metabolism. 4 Recent studies have uncovered a growing body of evidence linking choline to various diseases, such as neurologic disorders, metabolic syndromes, and liver disease. 4 Several choline transport proteins have been identi /uniFB01 ed and characterized in model systems, including SLC5A7, SLC44A1, SLC44A2, SLC44A4, SLC49A1, and SLC49A2. 5 -10 However, it is unclear which transporters affect systemic levels of free choline in humans and if they are linked to human genetic variation.

## METHODS

## Molecular biology

pDONR221\_SLC25A48 was a kind gift from the RESOLUTE Consortium (Addgene plasmid number 131995; http://n2t. net/addgene:131995; research resource identi /uniFB01 er [RRID]: Addgene\_131995). The SLC25A48 transcript was ligated into the pcDNA6. /uniFB02 ag vector, and mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (see Supplementary Methods for details).

## Cell culture

HEK293T and HeLa cell lines were cultured as described previously. 11 HEK293T cells were transfected with the calcium phosphate method, and HeLa cells with FuGENE HD (Promega E2311).

## Protein isolation, gel electrophoresis, and Western blot analysis

Proteins were isolated, separated using sodium dodecylsulfate -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to polyvinylidene di /uniFB02 uoride membranes, as described previously. 12 Antibodies were anti-Flag (Sigma Aldrich F3165) and ß-actin (Sigma Aldrich A1978). Chemiluminescence signals were captured with the Intas ChemoCam system. Western blot analyses are representative of 3 experiments with similar results (Supplementary Methods).

## Immuno uorescence /uniFB02

HeLa cells were prepared for indirect immuno /uniFB02 uorescence, as described in the Supplementary Methods. Confocal imaging was conducted on a Zeiss LSM980 MP AiryScan 2 microscope with a 63 /C2 objective. Quantitative colocalization analysis was performed with the Colocalization plugin in the Zeiss ZEN blue 3.4 software (Supplementary Methods).

## Mitochondrial isolation

HEK293T cells were grown and transfected in 500-cm 2 plates. Two days after transfection, cells were harvested and mitochondrial pellets were obtained. 13 Mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in a mitochondrial uptake buffer (KCl, 120 mM; sucrose, 25 mM; N -2-hydroxyethylpiperazineN 0 -2-ethanesulfonic acid, 10 mM; ethyleneglycol-bis-[ b - aminoethylether]N N,N ,N , 0 0 -tetraacetic acid, 1 mM; KH2PO4, 1 mM; MgCl2, 5 mM; glutamate, 15 mM; and malate, 7.5 mM, adjusted to a pH 7.2) 6 (see Supplementary Methods).

## 3 H choline transport studies

A total of 25 m g of mitochondria was suspended in 50 m l mitochondrial uptake buffer with subsequent addition of 2 /C2 choline buffer (mitochondrial uptake buffer supplemented with 20 m M choline chloride and 10 nM choline chloride [methyl-3H]) and incubated for 5 minutes. Samples were washed twice with ice-cold mitochondria washing buffer (mitochondrial uptake buffer with 20 m M choline chloride), and the pellet was resuspended in Ultima Gold scintillation cocktail for quanti /uniFB01 cation of 3H-choline content using liquid scintillation counting.

## Statistical analysis

GraphPad Prism 9.5.1 software was used to graph, analyze, and present the obtained data. All results are expressed as mean /C6 SEM. All experiments were independently performed at least 3 times. A 2-tailed Mann-Whitney test was used to calculate P values when the sample size (biological replicates) was at least 10, and an unpaired t -test was used when the sample size was &lt; 10. P &lt; 0.05 was considered signi /uniFB01 cant.

## Study population, choline measurements, and whole-exome sequencing

Genetic associations with plasma and urine choline levels, measured as part of the Metabolon HD4 Global Discovery metabolomics panel, were evaluated in the German Chronic Kidney Disease study. 14 The SLC25A48 gene was investigated using whole-exome sequencing data. Details about the study sample, choline measurements, and whole-exome sequencing (sequencing, alignment, and variant calling) are found in the Supplementary Methods.

## Variant annotation and rare variant testing

Called variants were annotated using Variant Effect Predictor version 109, incorporating various tools to predict deleteriousness. 15 -17 Loss-of-function variants for SLC25A48 were evaluated using the LoFtee Variant Effect Predictor plugin. 18 Two masks ("LoF\_mis" and "HI\_mis") that included rare variants (minor allele frequency &lt; 1%) were generated for variant aggregation testing. The LoF\_mis mask included highcon /uniFB01 dence loss-of-function variants, missense variants with a MetaSVM score &gt; 0, or in-frame nonsynonymous variants with a fathmm-XF-coding score &gt; 0.5, whereas the HI\_mis mask encompassed variants with high-impact consequences or missense variants meeting speci /uniFB01 c criteria. Burden tests, adjusting for covariates, were performed using the seqMeta Rpackage version 1.6.7. Statistical signi /uniFB01 cance was de /uniFB01 ned as P &lt; 0.05. Single-variant, covariate-adjusted association tests were conducted under additive modeling. Results are presented for the HI\_mis mask, which yielded lower association P values. Further details are presented in the Supplementary Methods.

## Associations with gene expression and human traits and diseases

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Methods related to the association of rare SLC25A48 variants with gene expression, as well as human traits and diseases from the UK Biobank (application identi /uniFB01 er 64806), are found in the Supplementary Methods.

## Structural model generation and analysis

The SLC25A48 AlphaFold 19 model was retrieved from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database hosted by the European Molecular Biology Laboratories -European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI; https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk, accession code Q6ZT89). To identify potential homologous proteins with experimental structures available, a sequencebased BLAST search of the Protein Data Bank as well as a structural homology based search using -the DALI Server 20 were performed. Details about the structures of other SLC25 family members, how they were superimposed, and how the matrix-open structure was modeled can be found in the Supplementary Methods. Figures were prepared using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Schrödinger, LLC.

We previously found through genome-wide association studies of metabolite levels that common SLC25A48 variants are associated with altered choline levels in urine (Figure 1a), 2 and now established that the genetic basis of this association is shared with plasma choline as well as SLC25A48 transcript levels in brain tissue (Supplementary Figure S1), supporting the hypothesis that the orphan solute carrier SLC25A48 may be a choline transporter. SLC25A48 transcript levels are highest in brain and kidney. Within the kidney, expression is high in epithelial cells of the S3 segment of the proximal tubule, a cell type rich in mitochondria with diverse energydemanding functions such as bulk reabsorption of /uniFB01 ltered solutes (Supplementary Figure S2). Overexpressed SLC25A48 localized to mitochondria in human epithelial cells (Figure 1b; Supplementary Figures S3 and S4). We, therefore, isolated mitochondria of cells overexpressing SLC25A48 and measured mitochondrial uptake of radiolabeled choline (Figure 1c). Mitochondria from cells overexpressing SLC25A48 showed a signi /uniFB01 cant increase of choline uptake compared with mitochondria from control cells (Figure 1d).

Conversely, small, interfering RNA -mediated knockdown of endogenous SLC25A48 signi /uniFB01 cantly reduced mitochondrial choline uptake and increased cytosolic choline concentration

(Supplementary Figure S5). Mitochondrial uptake of choline was time and concentration dependent (Figure 1e and f). These data support the hypothesis that SLC25A48 is a newly

identi /uniFB01 ed, high-af /uniFB01 nity mitochondrial choline transporter. SLC25A48 transports choline at nanomolar concentrations (Figure 1f), and thus operates at physiological concentrations of free choline in humans (7 -20 m M). 21

To test whether there is a causal link between altered choline levels in humans and impaired mitochondrial choline transport, we investigated the aggregated impact of rare, putatively damaging variants in SLC25A48 and found signi /uniFB01 cant associations with urine and plasma choline levels (burden test P ¼ 1.4 /C2 10 -17 and 4.2 /C2 10 -06 , respectively; Supplementary Table 1). Carriers of driver variants (Supplementary Methods) showed signi /uniFB01 cantly higher levels of choline compared with noncarriers, which was more pronounced in urine than in plasma (Figure 2a). Identi /uniFB01 ed driver variants mapped into different regions of SLC25A48 (Figure 2b). The association with choline was speci /uniFB01 c: no metabolite other than choline showed signi /uniFB01 cant genetic associations after correcting for multiple testing (Supplementary Figure S6).

Choline has been implicated in various human conditions, ranging from neurologic diseases to metabolic traits, but there is limited evidence linking genetic defects in choline transport to human disease. We, therefore, tested whether cholinerelated, putative loss-of-function mutations in SLC25A48 were associated with any of the human traits and diseases ascertained in the UK Biobank that are related to tissues where SLC25A48 is highly expressed (METHODS). None of the binary (Supplementary Table 2) or quantitative (Supplementary Table 3) traits was signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with SLC25A48 putative loss-of-function carrier status after correction for multiple testing.

To investigate whether implicated variants were causally related to altered choline levels, we generated 4 mutations in the SLC25A48 cDNA using site-directed mutagenesis and overexpressed these variants in human cell lines to study their effect on protein expression, localization, and function. Western blot analyses showed reduced protein expression of some, but not all, investigated SLC25A48 mutations compared with wild-type protein (Figure 2c). Interestingly, some mutations showed mislocalization from mitochondria (p.R179P and p.R243*), with a signi /uniFB01 cant reduction of the mitochondrial colocalization index compared with wild-type SLC25A48 (Figure 2d and e; Supplementary Figure S7), whereas other mutations localized to mitochondria like wild-type transporters (p.D27G and p.R64L; Supplementary Figure S7). These data show that only some of the investigated SLC25A48 mutations result in reduced protein expression and/or mislocalization.

We subsequently measured choline uptake in mitochondria to investigate which mutations affect SLC25A48 transport function. Despite differences in abundance and localization, all tested SLC25A48 mutations signi /uniFB01 cantly impaired mitochondrial choline uptake (Figure 2f). These data suggest that impaired mitochondrial choline transport via SLC25A48 results in altered plasma and urine choline levels in humans. This notion is supported by the increased cytosolic concentration of choline in SLC25A48-de /uniFB01 cient cells

(Supplementary Figure S5), which decreases the driving force for choline into cells via plasma membrane choline transporters. From a mechanistic standpoint, our data suggest that the investigated mutations cause loss-of-function through different pathogenic mechanisms, including reduced expression, mislocalization, and impaired substrate turnover with normal expression level and localization.

To gain a better mechanistic understanding of why speci /uniFB01 c mutations cause impaired transport, we analyzed structural models of SLC25A48 in 2 conformations (Figure 2g; Supplementary Figure S8). The SLC25A48 models were in good agreement with experimental structures of other SLC25 family members, such as the adenosine diphosphate/adenosine triphosphate carrier and mitochondrial uncoupling protein (Supplementary Figure S8). Notably, residue D27 is part of a matrix-salt-bridge network of conserved residues, which is a key component of the matrix gate of these transporters and, thus, essential for transport function. This is in line with the strongly impaired choline transport of p.D27G despite its normal localization. 22,23 The other mutations were also localized on the matrix side of the transporter and may affect its folding and stability. A limitation of this study is the lack of proteoliposome experiments with puri /uniFB01 ed SLC25A48. Future studies investigating SLC25A48 in proteoliposomes may provide deeper insights into the biophysical properties, the structure, and the function of this mitochondrial transporter.

In summary, we show that the physiological function of SLC25A48 in humans is choline import into mitochondria. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC25A48 impair choline transport into mitochondria and cause higher levels of free choline in urine and plasma. The deorphanization of SLC25A48 de /uniFB01 nes its molecular function in humans and enables future well-powered studies addressing its role in health and disease.

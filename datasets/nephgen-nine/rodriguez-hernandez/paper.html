<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Summary: This article introduces the metaGWASmanager, which streamlines genome-wide association studies within large-scale meta-analysis consortia. It is a toolbox for both the central consortium analysis group and participating studies to generate homogeneous phenotypes, minimize unwanted variability from inconsistent methodologies, ensure high-quality association results, and implement time-efficient quality control workflows. The toolbox features a plug-in-based approach for customization of association testing.</p>
<p>Results: The metaGWASmanager toolbox has been successfully deployed in both the CKDGen and MetalGWAS Initiative consortia across hundreds of participating studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in GWAS analysis optimization by automating routine tasks and ensuring the value and reliability of association results, thus, ultimately promoting scientific discovery. We provide a simulated data set with examples for script customization so that readers can reproduce the pipeline at their convenience.</p>

<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Genome-Wide Association  Studies  (GWAS)  aim  to  unravel genes implicated in health and disease and advance our understanding of physiology and pathology (Tam et al. 2019). In  GWAS,  obtaining  meaningful  results  involves  increasing sample sizes through meta-analysis, as exemplified by the saturation of height GWAS signals with multi-million individuals (Yengo et al. 2022). Partnership within consortia, as seen in the collaborative efforts of CKDGen  over  a  decade (Kottgen and Pattaro 2020), is critical to achieving these sam-€ ple sizes. Consortia typically establish a centralized analysis group, and study-specific analysts follow a predefined analysis plan. To ensure reliable results, maintaining high-quality, standardized  phenotypic  data  and  genotypes  across  studies and quality control on the contributing study summary statistics are imperative.</p>
<p>Therefore, we aim to offer a versatile framework that can be universally applied to accomplish complex tasks with different tools  for  phenotype  generation  and  statistical  analyses.  This intends to minimize between-studies heterogeneity originating from  the  use  of  inconsistent  methodologies,  disparate  data preparation, or divergent tools for statistical tests, and to save time by automating routine tasks both for the central Consortium Analysts (CA) group and the Study Analysts (SA).</p>
<p>In  this  article,  we  introduce  a  comprehensive  toolbox leveraging  existing  software  packages  and  streamlining  the entire consortia workflow. This includes harmonization and quality control of phenotypes, GWAS, quality control reports of GWAS (in the form of test statistics and plots) and metaanalysis, providing an integrated solution for study sites and central analysis teams (Fig. 1).</p>
<h2>2 Methods and workflow</h2>
<p>For the presented tools, we build on R, Bash and Python as a foundation  universally  available  across  study  sites.  While CAs benefit  from  some  familiarity  with  these  languages  to customize the toolbox to the consortium, SAs do not need specific coding skills. To fulfill the unique needs of each consortium, we adopted a plug-in concept, allowing for the flexible  customization  of  the  analysis  pipeline  with  respect  to phenotype preparation and used association software tools.</p>
<p>Our toolbox addresses two groups of users. First, the CA group  is  responsible  for  the  analysis  plan,  pre-  and  post-</p>

Shaded and white sections indicate tasks to be carried out by CAs and SAs, respectively.</figcaption></figure>
<p>GWAS  quality  control  design,  meta-analysis,  and  other downstream analyses. CAs do not have access to individuallevel participant data. Second, the SA performs the phenotype preparation and association analyses at the study level and upload their results to the consortium server.</p>
<p>The  workflow  comprises  five  phases  and  is  presented  in Fig. 1. In the first phase, starting with an analysis plan, the CAs customize the metaGWASmanager scripts according to the  specific  requirements  of  the  consortium.  The  CAs  can easily  adopt  the consortium-specifics.R plug-in  file  to  meet diverse requirements aligned with the accompanying analysis plan. This enables customization of the entire analysis process, ranging from SA phenotype preparation over the actual GWAS to the centralized summary statistics quality control and  meta-analysis  by  the  CA  group.  MetaGWASmanager currently implements plink 2.0 (Chang et al. 2015) and regenie  (Mbatchou et  al. 2021)  association  softwares  and  can easily  be  customized for other tools. The analysis plan and the  customized  toolbox  are  distributed  to  the  participating SAs.</p>
<p>In the second phase, the SAs prepare a study-specific phenotype  file,  using  a  programming  language  of  their  choice, and run the toolbox to check and summarize it. The script conducts  a  thorough  examination  of  the  input  file,  issuing warnings and detecting errors to ensure high-quality phenotypic data and avoid common pitfalls like wrong unit conversions or variations in assay  methods.  Furthermore,  the pipeline performs necessary trait transformations, stratification, and calculations, standardizing the phenotypic data for consistency. SAs then upload the generated phenotype summary statistics (not containing individual-level data) and diagnostic  plots  (Supplementary  Data),  including  descriptive graphs of trait-specific variables to the CAs.</p>
<p>In the third phase, CAs inspect phenotype distributions, detect outliers, and validate across studies (Fig. 1). After phenotype approval, in phase 4, studies proceed with the preparation of their genotypic data in a compatible format, with  the  help  of  provided  scripts,  and  execute  the  GWAS. The  toolbox  provides  job  scripts  and  includes  GWAS  tool command  line  options  to  ensure  best  practice  analysis. Results are packaged in a standardized way to facilitate CA group analyses.  These  include  marker  association  statistics, phenotype summaries of the phenotypes actually used for association after sample exclusions, and diagnostic log files.</p>
<p>In phase 5, to maintain the highest possible data quality, the CAs employ code to properly format and verify GWAS statistics.  GWAS  files  are  examined  using  the  GWASinspector  R package (Ani et al. 2021). A wide variety of diagnostic reports are generated to facilitate the check for several potential issues, including  discrepancies  in  genomic  builds,  allele  switches  and swaps, missing data, file and number formatting issues, unaccounted inflation, and incorrect transformations. The CA group communicates  any  identified  issue  back  to  the  respective  SA for resolution.</p>
<p>Lastly, our pipeline facilitates progress tracking and reporting by generating tables and plots that allow for efficient  monitoring  of  the  consortium's  progress,  such  as  ongoing  GWAS  status,  studies  awaiting  analysis,  and  current sample sizes. These tracking mechanisms are crucial for effective coordination and management of the consortium effort.  Once  data  collection  and  QC  is  complete,  the  actual GWAS  meta-analysis  is  conducted  using  METAL  (Willer et al. 2010).</p>
<h2>3 Applications in the CKDGen and metals consortia</h2>
<p>The presented toolbox has been developed in the context of the  CKDGen  consortium  (Teumer et  al. 2019,  Tin et  al. 2019, 2021, Wuttke et al. 2019, Schlosser et al. 2021) and has  recently  been  successfully  applied  in  an  ongoing  largescale GWAS meta-analyses with over 130 participating studies of &gt; 2 million individuals with 18 endpoints and a total of &gt; 1,800 unique GWAS. We show exemplary phenotype and cleaning diagnostic plots and reports along with comprehensive documentation in the Supplementary data.</p>
<p>To  prove  the  transferability  of  the  workflow,  we  implemented the same tools with the recently established MetalGWAS Initiative studying &gt; 40 phenotypes in � 10 studies (https://biodama.isciii.es/metal-gwas/).</p>
<p>Furthermore,  we  provide  sample  scripts  to  run  the  complete process using simulated data.</p>
<h2>4 Conclusion</h2>
<p>The metaGWASmanager aids to identify an increased number of associated variants by reducing between-study heterogeneity from inconsistent methodologies in phenotype preparation  and  divergent  tools  in  association  analyses.  By establishing  output  file  consistency,  it  supports  the  metaanalyses  processes.  Its  technical  foundation  in  R,  Bash  and Python, along with the flexible plug-in concept and comprehensive documentation, facilitates quick implementations in a  wide  range  of  settings.  The  provided  simulated  data  set with examples of script customization will allow readers to easily reproduce and familiarize themselves with the pipeline.</p>
<p>The metaGWASmanager tool significantly streamlines analytical  workflows  by  automating  routine  tasks,  ultimately saving  valuable  time  of  the  GWAS  consortium  team  and making the scientific output more robust, thus facilitating biological discovery.</p>

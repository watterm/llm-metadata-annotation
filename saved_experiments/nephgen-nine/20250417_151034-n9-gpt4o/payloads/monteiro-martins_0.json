They are regulated via the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and have a heritable component. Using genetic information, we applied tissue-specific transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and plasma proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) to elucidate gene products related to thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels.\n\nResults: TWAS identified 297 and 113 transcripts associated with TSH and FT4 levels, respectively (25 shared), including transcripts not identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these traits, demonstrating the increased power of this approach. Testing for genetic colocalization revealed a shared genetic basis of 158 transcripts with TSH and 45 transcripts with FT4, including independent, FT4-associated genetic signals within the CAPZB locus that were differentially associated with CAPZB expression in different tissues. PWAS identified 18 and ten proteins associated with TSH and FT4, respectively (HEXIM1 and QSOX2 with both). Among these, the cognate genes of five TSH- and 7 FT4-associated proteins mapped outside significant GWAS loci. Colocalization was observed for five plasma proteins each with TSH and FT4. There were ten TSH and one FT4-related gene(s) significant in both TWAS and PWAS. Of these, ANXA5 expression and plasma annexin A5 levels were inversely associated with TSH (PWAS: P = 1.18 \u00d7 10 -13 , TWAS: P = 7.61 \u00d7 10 -12 (whole blood), P = 6.40 \u00d7 10 -13 (hypothalamus), P = 1.57 \u00d7 10 -15 (pituitary), P = 4.27 \u00d7 10 -15 (thyroid)), supported by colocalizations.\n\nConclusion : Our analyses revealed new thyroid function-associated genes and prioritized candidates in known GWAS loci, contributing to a better understanding of transcriptional regulation and protein levels relevant to thyroid function.\n\nKeywords: TWAS; PWAS; HPT axis; thyroid; hypothalamus; pituitary; TSH; FT4; colocalization; metabolism\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Introduction\n\nThyroid hormones (TH) affect cellular metabolism and thereby have vital functions for growth and metabolic homeostasis  (1).  Thyroid  function  is  governed  by  the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid  (HPT)  axis,  where  the thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus stimulates  the  release  of  thyrotropin  (TSH)  from  the anterior  pituitary  gland,  which  in  turn  results  in  the production of the main hormones of the thyroid gland, thyroxine (T4) and  triiodothyronine (T3). Feedback loops  at different levels of the HPT  axis  maintain stable  thyroid  function.  Many  of  the  important  genes involved  in  the  HPT  axis  have  been  uncovered  by  the study  of  monogenic  disorders  of  thyroid  function  (2, 3). However,  important  new  knowledge  remains  to be  uncovered,  as  evidenced  by  recent  GWAS  of  TSH and free T4 (FT4) levels that identified both a new TH transport  protein  encoded  by SLC17A4, as  well  as  a previously unknown TH-metabolizing enzyme encoded by AADAT (4).  Hypothesis-generating screens based on genetic  information  are  therefore  suitable  to  identify and  prioritize  previously  unknown  players  in  thyroid function. A dedicated analysis of all known TH-regulating genes  (5)  moreover  revealed  that  variants  in  these genes detected by GWAS only accounted for a small percentage of variation in thyroid function measures.  This  suggests  the  presence  of  undiscovered TH-regulating genes within the HPT axis. A recent largescale GWAS  meta-analysis  investigated  the  genetics of  thyroid  function  parameters  such  as  TSH,  FT4,  and T3-related  traits  (6).  The  current  study  builds  on  this GWAS  and  investigates  the  two  most  commonly  used thyroid function markers, TSH and FT4, which were also the focus of previous GWAS on thyroid function (4).\n\nAs a genome-wide screen, GWAS needs to be stringently corrected  for  multiple  tests,  which  can  result  in  the missing of true association signals. Moreover, significant GWAS  loci  often  contain  several  genes,  complicating the  prioritization  of  the  causal  gene.  Lastly,  GWAS  do not  provide  information  about  tissue-specific  effects, although most common genetic variants implicated by GWAS are intronic or intergenic and may differentially affect gene expression. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)  can  address  these  three  challenges by  studying  the  effect  of  genetically  predicted,  tissuespecific differential gene expression on a disease or trait of  interest  (7,  8).  TWAS  utilizes  genomic  information associated with a specific phenotype (GWAS) and weight matrices, which are computed using SNP-mRNA associations  (expression  quantitative  trait  loci,  eQTL) data for the relevant tissues from GTEx v8 postmortem tissue from donors, acquired from rapid autopsy and  organ  procurement  organizations  (9,  10).  These matrices quantify the relationship between  genetic variants  and  gene  expression  levels.  TWAS  thereby only  needs  to  correct  for  the  number  of  evaluated transcripts  across  tissues  and  directly  implicate  the investigated  gene  product  as  a  molecular  trait  that links genetic variation to the disease or trait of interest. Proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) represent an analogous approach by studying the effect of genetically predicted protein levels, currently focused on the plasma proteome (11). In addition to the advantages of TWAS, PWAS can identify trait correlations with plasma protein levels  that  are  mediated  through  mechanisms  other than their differential gene expression, such as the trans effects of TSH and FT4 on the circulating proteome. This analysis can give us insights into the HPT axis, and to the best of our knowledge, such analyses have not been applied to investigate other endocrine axes.\n\nThe aims of this study were, therefore, to use TWAS and PWAS  to  uncover  additional  thyroid  function-related genes  previously  unreported  in  GWAS,  to  prioritize potentially  causal  genes  in  TSH-  and  FT4-associated GWAS  loci,  to  contrast  different  tissues  of  the  HPT axis, and  to  characterize  the  identified  associations through  a  series  of  downstream  analyses.  Here,  we unravel  new  thyroid  function-related  genes,  reflecting the increased power of TWAS and PWAS analyses, while also  providing  valuable  insights  into  shared  genetic signals  underlying  transcript  and  protein  levels  and thyroid function levels. The  resulting prioritization of genes in GWAS loci contributes to a better understanding  of  the  genetic  architecture  underlying thyroid  hormone  regulation  and  implicated  numerous previously unreported relationships, such as those for ANXA5 transcript and protein levels.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\n\nGWAS  of  inverse  normal  transformed  values  of  free T4  levels  ( n =  119,120 from  37  cohorts)  revealed  85 independent  significant  SNPs  ( Pvalue  &lt;  5  \u00d710 -8 ),  and of  inverse  normal  transformed  TSH  levels  ( n =  271,040 from 46 cohorts) resulted in 259 independent significant SNPs. All study participants were of European ancestry. Individual study files were filtered by  MAF  &gt;  0.005  and  by  imputation  quality  &gt;  0.4  at the  marker  level.  For  the  meta-analysis,  SNPs  with minor  allele  frequency  (MAF)  &lt;  0.01  or  SNPs  present in &lt;75% of the sample size were excluded. GWAS were performed using genome assembly hg37. Variant identifiers (rsIDs) were annotated and genomic positions were converted to genome assembly GRCh38 (hg38) using the liftOver function from the rtracklayer R package (12).\n\n## Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)\n\nTWAS were performed following the FUSION workflow (13) based on weights from GTEx v8 tissues (European ancestry) considered relevant for thyroid function\n\n(brain hypothalamus,  pituitary, thyroid, and  whole blood). Gene expression weights and linkage disequilibrium (LD) reference data for persons of European  (EUR)  ancestry  from  1000  Genomes  Project (1000G) were downloaded from http://gusevlab.org/ projects/fusion/. Prediction models were based on elastic net modeling (13). Multiple testing was accounted for  by  a  Bonferroni  adjustment  for  the  number  of unique  transcripts  modeled  across  traits  and  tissues ( P -value &lt; 1.74 \u00d7 10 -6 =  0.05/28,768 transcripts). FT3 TWAS was  performed  for  a  selected  candidate  gene, ANXA5 . Overlap  with  significant  GWAS  loci  was  determined using GWAS variants with P -value &lt; 5 \u00d7 10 -8 in a 250 kb window around the TWAS gene.\n\n## Proteome-wide association studies (PWAS)\n\nPWAS  were  performed  based  on  an  adapted  version of  the  FUSION  workflow  ( 13)  using  plasma  protein weights from the European ancestry (EA) subpopulation of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study ( n =  7213)  (ARIC)  (11),  where  plasma  protein  levels  had been  measured  using  the  aptamer-based  Somascan technology (V.4.1 platform). Protein weights and LD reference files were downloaded from http:// nilanjanchatterjeelab.org/pwas/. Prediction models were based on elastic net modeling (13). Multiple testing was accounted for by a Bonferroni adjustment for the number  of  unique  aptamers  modeled  across  traits ( P -value  &lt;  3.78  \u00d7  10 -5 =  0.05  /  1322  aptamers).  Overlap with significant GWAS  loci was determined using GWAS  variants  with P -value  &lt;5  \u00d7  10 -8 in  a  250  kb window around the PWAS gene.\n\n## Conditionally independent colocalization analysis\n\nA  colocalization  analysis  of  independent  signals  was performed for each significant association. Colocalization of TWAS findings was performed using publicly available cis -eQTL  summary  statistics  from  GTEx  v8 (EUR). For PWAS, we used cis -protein quantitative trait loci  (pQTL) summary statistics from EA participants of the  ARIC  study  (11 ).  As  LD  reference  data,  we  used  a subset  of  15,000  genomically  British  participants  from the  UK  Biobank  (application  number  20272);  genomic positions were converted to genome assembly GRCh38 (hg38) using the liftOver function from the rtracklayer R  package  (12).  Plasma  proteins  and  gene  expression summary  statistics were extracted for every gene significant  by  TWAS  or  PWAS  with  a  250  kb  flanking region.  First,  independent  association  signals  within these  regions  were  identified  based  on  approximate conditional  analyses  via  the  GCTA  COJO-Slct  algorithm (14),  with default parameters ( P -value &lt; 5 \u00d7 10 -8 and a collinearity of 0.9). For each conditionally independent SNP,  conditional  summary  statistics  were  computed by  conditioning  on  all  other  independent  SNPs  in  the gene region using the GCTA COJO-Cond algorithm with default parameters (collinearity of 0.9) (14). Subsequently, approximate Bayes factors-based colocalization analyses were conducted for all pairwise combinations of independent  eQTL/pQTL  associations  against  the independent thyroid function GWAS associations (15)  using  an  adapted  version  of  the  Giambartolomei colocalization  method  as  implemented  in  the  'coloc. fast' function (https://github.com/tobyjohnson/gtx), with default  parameters  and  prior  definitions  ( 16).  Positive colocalizations were reported if the posterior probability of a shared causal variant (PPH4/p12) was \u22650.8.\n\n## GO, KEGG, and tissue enrichment analyses\n\nEnrichment  testing  of  the  significant  genes  identified by  TWAS for TSH (297 genes) and for FT4 (113 genes) was performed in different resources using gene ontology  (GO)  terms  (17),  Kyoto  encyclopedia  of  genes and  genomes  (KEGG)  pathways  (18),  Human  protein atlas  (HPA)  tissues  (19),  and  GTEx  v8  tissues  (9),  with highly  expressed  genes  in  each  tissue  defined  as  the top 10% most highly expressed genes. For more details on  the  processing  of  the  tissue  resources,  see  ref.  20. For  all  enrichment  analyses,  we  used  hypergeometric tests implemented  in  the  R  package  clusterProfiler version 4.0.5 (21), where we selected the overlap of the 15,422  genes  encoding  for  transcripts  analyzed  during TWAS  with the genes available in the respective resource as background genes. When testing for enrichment  in  GO  terms  and  KEGG  pathways,  after overlapping with the available genes in the respective resource,  the  gene  set  originating  from  TSH  contained 186 and 95 genes, the gene set originating from FT4  contained  76  and  38  genes,  and  the  number  of background  genes  was  reduced  to  9629  and  4339, respectively. When performing tissue-specific enrichment analyses, the gene set  assigned  to  a  tissue was  filtered  for  genes  encoding  transcripts  analyzed during  TWAS.  All  results  were  filtered  for  terms  with at least two genes. P -values were corrected for multiple testing  using  the  Benjamini-Hochberg  procedure  (22) separately in each of the different resources.\n\n## Investigation of significant genes for associations with human traits and diseases through PheWAS\n\nWe  performed  queries  of  phenome-wide  association results  using  the  AstraZeneca  PheWAS  Portal.  These results  are  based  on  the  UK  Biobank  whole-exome sequencing  data  (469,809  UK  Biobank  exomes)  and contain associations for phenotypes derived from electronic health records, questionnaire data, and continuous  traits  released  by  UK  Biobank  (23).  We limited our queries to gene-level associations to directly  link  them  with  genes  detected  in  our  TWAS (385  genes)  and  PWAS  (28  genes).  Gene-level  analyses\n\nwere  based  on  collapsing  analyses,  which  aggregated rare, putatively deleterious, qualifying variants in each gene  with  given  criteria,  including  ten  dominant  and one recessive model, and testing them against a given phenotype. P -values for binary traits associations were determined by Fisher's exact two-sided test, and P -values for quantitative traits were determined by linear regression corrected for age, sex, and their interaction (age \u00d7 sex). We considered all available binary endpoints ( n =  10,088) and quantitative endpoints ( n =  1927). The total number  of  unique  phenotypes  was n =  14,956. Therefore, we defined the following significance thresholds  for  our  queries: P -value  &lt;  1.19  \u00d7  10 -7 (0.05 /  (28  genes  \u00d7  14,956  phenotypes))  for  genes  implicated by PWAS, and P -value &lt; 8.68 \u00d7 10 -9 (0.05 / (385 genes \u00d7 14,956 phenotypes)) for those implicated by TWAS. The queries  were  further  filtered  to  retain  binary  traits with more than 100 cases and controls and continuous traits  with  more  than  30  observations.  Additionally, the number of cases or controls with qualifying variants  in binary  phenotypes  and  the  number  of participants  with  qualifying  variants  in  quantitative phenotypes had to exceed 3.\n\n## Results\n\n## TWAS reveal expressed genes related to thyroid hormone metabolism\n\nWe performed an HPT axis tissue-specific TWAS based  on  gene  expression  models  derived  from  GTEx project v8 data (Supplementary Table 1, see section on supplementary materials given at the end of this article) (9,  13)  and  GWAS  summary  statistics  of  TSH  and  FT4 derived  from  up  to  271,040  individuals  of  European ancestry across 46 predominantly  population-based cohorts  from  the  ThyroidOmics  Consortium  (Fig.  1). Each transcript was predicted using tissue-specific gene  expression  information,  which  allowed  for  the identification  of  genetic  variants  associated  with  gene expression levels in the relevant tissue (i.e. hypothalamus, pituitary,  thyroid,  and  whole  blood).  Across  tissues, TWAS  yielded  297  and  113  transcripts  significantly associated  with  TSH  and  FT4,  respectively  (Fig.  2).  A total of 25  transcripts  were  significantly  associated with both hormones. Of these, 20 transcripts exhibited inverse  associations,  meaning  that  their  correlation with TSH was opposite to that with FT4 (Supplementary Fig. 1A and Supplementary  Table 2). The thyroid gland yielded the highest number of significant findings across all studied tissues, accounting  for  76.8%  of significant findings from TWAS of TSH and 64.6% from TWAS  of  FT4  (Fig.  2,  Supplementary  Fig.  1B,  C  and Supplementary Table 2).\n\nFrom  the  297  unique  transcripts  associated  with  TSH in one or more tissues, 24 were not encoded by a gene mapping into a significant GWAS  locus. Likewise, the  genes  encoding  14  out  of  the  113  significant  FT4associated  transcripts  did  not  map  into  a  significant\n\nGWAS  locus  (Methods,  Supplementary  Table  2).  Thus, TWAS enabled a gain in power to detect novel thyroid function-associated signals due to the reduced multiple testing  burden  of  gene-based  analysis  as  opposed  to variant-based analysis.\n\nTo assess whether the implicated transcripts represented a molecular link between genetic variation and  TSH  or  FT4  levels  or  independent  associations  in the  same  genetic  region,  we  performed  conditional genetic colocalization analyses. Strong  evidence  for colocalization, i.e. the posterior probability of a shared underlying  causal  variant  (PPH4  &gt;  0.8;  Methods),  was identified  between  thyroid  function  (GWAS)  and  gene expression for 158 (TSH) and 45 (FT4) transcripts in at least  one  of  the  studied  tissues  (Fig.  2,  Supplementary Figs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and Supplementary Table 3). These colocalization  results  are  consistent  with  regions  in which regulatory  variants  affect  both  gene  expression and thyroid function, thereby enabling the prioritization of potentially causal genes in the GWAS loci.\n\nReassuringly,  significant  findings  from  TWAS  of  TSH and FT4 contained multiple positive controls, i.e., transcripts encoded by genes known to have important roles in thyroid hormone  regulation.  For  example, TPO , encoding  the  TH-synthesizing  enzyme  thyroid peroxidase, and PDE8B , encoding phosphodiesterase 8B that catalyzes cAMP hydrolysis, a key second messenger in  TSH  signaling,  were  associated  with  both  TSH  and FT4. Testing for colocalization confirmed  a  shared genetic signal underlying both higher thyroid TPO and PDE8B expression  and  higher  levels  of  TSH,  as  well as  lower  levels  of  FT4  (Supplementary  Fig.  10).  In  line with  known  physiology,  the  colocalization  of  TSH  and FT4 GWAS signals with gene expression was present in thyroid  tissue,  but  not  in  the  hypothalamus,  pituitary, or whole blood. Along the same lines, the colocalization of  transcript  levels  of  the  TSH  receptor  encoding  for the gene TSHR with  TSH was present solely in thyroid tissue. This finding is in line with the fact that the TSH receptor is  predominantly expressed (9) and exerts its main function on the thyroid, as the TWAS of FT4 did not show a significant association (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 3).\n\n## Tissue-specific differential CAPZB expression links independent genetic variants to altered TSH levels\n\nWe  observed  a  significant  association  for CAPZB in both  thyroid-specific  ( P -value = 2.02  \u00d7  10 -215 )  as  well  as pituitary-specific  ( P -value = 1.57  \u00d7  10 -15 )  TWAS  of  TSH (Fig. 3). CAPZB expression models were unavailable for hypothalamus-  and  whole  blood-specific  TWAS  due  to the lack of significant heritability of the eQTL in these datasets. Nevertheless, colocalization analyses between GWAS and  gene  expression  could  be  conducted  in  all HPT  tissues. These  analyses  revealed  colocalization between  genetically higher TSH  levels and higher levels of CAPZB expression in both thyroid (PPH4 = 0.99)\n\nFigure 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWorkflow of integrated transcriptome and proteome-wide association studies of thyroid hormones TSH and FT4.\n\nand  hypothalamus  (PPH4 = 0.89).  A  moderately  strong colocalization  signal  (PPH4 = 0.75)  between  genetically higher TSH levels and higher levels of CAPZB expression in the pituitary was also identified. Interestingly, independent  TSH-associated  genetic  variants  seemed to differentially modulate CAPZB expression in a tissuedependent  manner,  as  shown  in  Fig.  3A:  whereas  a TSH-associated  genetic  signal  upstream  of CAPZB also underlies differential CAPZB expression in the thyroid, another  independent  genetic  signal  centered  on  the gene  body  underlies  differential CAPZB expression  in hypothalamus.\n\nTo further substantiate the regulatory potential of these  variants,  we  analyzed  functional  genomics  data from  thyroid  tissue  generated  by  the  ENCODE  Project Consortium and found that rs10799824, the implicated variant  upstream  of CAPZB , overlapped  with  open chromatin  (ATAC-seq).  Notably,  this  position  was  not accessible in other tissues from the same tissue donor (ENCDO451RUA)  ( Fig. 3B ), supporting tissue-specific regulatory  function.  These  findings  were  confirmed in  thyroid  tissue  of  a  different  donor  (ENCDO793LXB) (Methods,  Supplementary  Fig.  11A).  We  looked  into PheWeb using 1400 EHR-derived broad phenome-\n\nA\n\nB\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Figure 2\n\nResults of tissue-specific TWAS analyses.

To investigate potential relationships between the genes identified through our TWAS approach and rare damaging  variants  associated with thyroid disease, we  investigated  the  individual  and  aggregated  effects of  rare,  putatively  damaging  genetic  variants  across the exome using whole-exome sequencing and clinical  outcome  data  from  the  UK  Biobank  (23),  as implemented in the AZ Portal (Methods).  Our  analysis revealed  significant  associations  for  the  TSH  receptor gene with endocrine  and  metabolic diseases, such as hypothyroidism.  We  identified  other  associations described  in  Supplementary  Fig.  12,  Supplementary Tables 4 and 5.\n\n## Pathway enrichment for TWAS findings\n\nWe  next  performed  overrepresentation  analyses  for genes  encoding  for  significantly  associated  transcripts from  TWAS  using  GO  and  KEGG  databases  to  identify enriched pathways (Methods). For TSH, enriched biological processes (GO) and metabolic pathways (KEGG) were related to growth factors, cAMPmediated  signaling,  and  cAMP  biosynthetic  process. Additionally,  genes  encoding  for  associated  transcripts were  overrepresented  in  morphine  addiction,  relaxin signaling pathway, dopaminergic synapse, and chemical carcinogenesis, among others (Supplementary Fig. 13A and Supplementary Table 6). For FT4, enriched molecular functions  and  biological  processes  (GO),  as  well  as metabolic pathways (KEGG), were related to metabolic processes,  thyroid  hormone  generation,  metabolism, and signaling, as well as chemical carcinogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 13B and Supplementary Table 6).\n\nOverrepresentation analyses to identify tissues in which  the  target  transcripts  were  highly  expressed (Methods)  revealed  thyroid  tissue  for  both  TSH  and FT4  and  additionally  minor  salivary  gland  for  TSH (Supplementary Table 7). These results provide evidence  that  transcripts  implicated  by  TWAS  of  TSH and  FT4  are  indeed  involved  in  molecular  pathways that  are  relevant  to  thyroid  function  and  molecular metabolism, including TSH and FT4 regulation.\n\n## PWAS reveal plasma proteins related to thyroid function\n\nPWAS revealed significant associations between genetically predicted levels of 18 plasma proteins\n\n(Methods)  with  TSH  and  10  with  FT4.  Two  proteins, protein HEXIM1 and Sulfhydryl oxidase 2 (QSOX2), were associated with both hormones (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig.  14A  and  Supplementary  Table  8).  Evidence  for  a shared  causal  variant  from  colocalization  testing  was observed  for  five  TSH-  and  five  FT4-related  proteins (Supplementary Table 9). Although HEXIM1 and Sulfhydryl  oxidase  2  were  not  among  the  proteins  for which  colocalization  was  observed,  dedicated  testing for colocalization with gene expression showed  a shared genetic signal underlying FT4 levels and QSOX2 expression  in  both  thyroid  and  pituitary  (PPH4 = 0.969 and 0.968, respectively).\n\nFrom all significant plasma proteins detected by PWAS  of  thyroid  function,  the  genes  encoding  for  5 and  7  proteins  did  not  map  into  a  significant  GWAS locus for TSH  and  FT4,  respectively  (see  Methods, Supplementary  Table  8).  Details  about  the  function  of these novel TH-related candidates are summarized in  Supplementary  Table  10  (TSH)  and  Supplementary Table 11 (FT4).\n\nThere  were  11  significant  shared  findings  between PWAS  and  TWAS:  10  with  TWAS  of  TSH,  including HEXIM1,  and  one  with  TWAS  of  FT4  (Supplementary Fig.  14B  and  C),  providing  evidence  for  a  molecular chain  connecting  genetic  variation,  gene  expression, and protein levels with thyroid function. In particular, ANXA5  (annexin  A5)  showed  colocalization  between TSH-associated genetic variants with both their plasma protein  and  their  gene  expression  levels  in  HPT  axis tissues (Supplementary Table 12).\n\n## Annexin A5 is inversely associated with TSH levels\n\nWe observed a significant inverse association between plasma levels of  annexin  A5  and  TSH  (PWAS P -value =  1.18 \u00d7 10 -13 ), and an inverse association between TSH and ANXA5 expression in the hypothalamus (TWAS P -value = 6.40 \u00d7 10 -13 ), pituitary (TWAS P -value = 1.57  \u00d7  10 -15 ),  thyroid  (TWAS P -value = 4.27  \u00d7  10 -15 ), and  whole  blood  (TWAS P -value = 7.61  \u00d7  10 -12 ).  These findings  were  supported  by  colocalization  testing:  we observed  colocalization  between  TSH  GWAS  and  both annexin A5 plasma protein levels and gene expression in  all  studied  tissues,  with  lower  TSH  levels  related to  higher  protein  and  expression  levels.  In  line  with these  findings,  colocalization  between  plasma  protein and  gene  expression  levels  was  also  observed  with  a positive correlation (Fig. 5A).\n\nAnnexin A5 (Anxa A5, annexin V) is a member of the Ca 2+ -dependent phospholipid-binding protein family of annexins,  functioning  as  a  membrane  stabilizer. Once the membrane is bound, the function of annexins can vary: some members of the annexin family act in vesicle  trafficking  or  membrane  organization  ( 1,  25). Furthermore,  annexins,  including  annexin  A5,  have been  described  to  function  as  a  Ca 2+   channel  under certain conditions (25 ).  The  latter  finding  is  of  interest\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Figure 4\n\nResults of plasma PWAS analyses.

(B) Simplified conceptual model of annexin A5 exhibiting calcium channel activity in thyroid cells. Calcium is required for the H202 formation in the iodination process in the presence of NADPH, O2, dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2), and thyroid peroxidase (TPO). Subsequently, iodination of tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin (TG) takes place to form, after coupling, the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. * indicates a significant association found in TWAS.

Image created with BioRender .com.\n\nbecause  calcium  is  required  in  the  iodination  process and H2O2 production to form thyroid hormones (1). Additionally, a previous  study  showed  that  on continuous  daily  administration  of  calcium  channel blockers, a gradual fall in levels of T3 and T4 with a rise in TSH levels was observed in rabbits (26). Our results showed a positive although non-significant association between  FT4  and  FT3  levels  and ANXA5 expression in  the  thyroid  (TWAS P -value = 1.27  \u00d7  10 -02 and  TWAS P -value = 1.02  \u00d7  10 -01 , respectively),  and  a  significant inverse  relation  between  thyroid ANXA5 expression levels and  TSH,  consistent with  stimulation of TH production  in  presence  of  annexin  A5  and  displaying the negative feedback loop (Fig. 5b).\n\n## Connecting PWAS discoveries to rare thyroid-related variants using PheWAS\n\nWe  investigated whether  rare putatively damaging variants in the cognate genes of plasma proteins identified in PWAS  showed  significant associations across  a  broad  range  of  clinical  traits  and  diseases. We identified potential connections between rare variants in the genes encoding for plasma protein levels whose  predicted  levels  were  significantly  associated with  thyroid  traits  in  PWAS  (Supplementary  Fig.  15, Supplementary  Tables 13 and 14). Gene-phenotype associations were observed for PSCK1 (from FT4 analyses) with higher fat mass, weight, and phenotypes related to body mass index. Additionally, plasma levels of peptide YY (PYY), a gut hormone involved in appetite regulation and obesity, were also associated with PSCK1 (27). PSCK1 encodes the prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), a serine endoprotease responsible for processing precursor proteins as pro-neuropeptides and  prohormones  (28).  Moreover, IHH identified  by PWAS of FT4, was associated with respiratory function and  height-related  phenotypes.  It  encodes  a  signaling molecule  associated  with  the  regulation  of  skeletal growth  and  development,  phenotypes  influenced  by thyroid  hormones.  Lastly, HGFAC , which  encodes  a protease  that  activates  the  hepatocyte  growth  factor hormone  revealed  in  the  FT4  PWAS,  was  associated with  sex  hormone-binding  globulin  (SHBG).  Thyroid hormones  (T3  and  T4)  were  shown  to  act  indirectly to  increase  SHBG  production  in  the  liver  (29),  and could thus be part of the pathway from HGFAC expression to SHBG levels.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis  systematic  study  of  the  relation  of  genetically predicted tissue-specific levels of gene expression and  the  plasma  proteome  with  the  most  commonly quantified thyroid function-related hormones, TSH and FT4,  has  several  principal  findings:  first,  we  identified thyroid function-associated transcripts and  proteins that are missed by conventional GWAS even at sample sizes well over 250,000 individuals. Secondly, the analyses can help prioritize genes in GWAS  loci, including previously identified loci. Thirdly, conditional colocalization analyses increased confidence in candidates  that  share  a  genetic  basis  with  TH  and provided information about tissue-specific and tissue-shared  effects  on  gene  expression.  Functional annotation of candidate variants implicated a potentially causal,  TSH-related  regulatory  variant  driving CAPZB expression  in  the thyroid. Fourthly, shared  genetic causes of transcript, protein, and TSH levels support the role of annexin A5 in TH regulation.\n\nIn  comparison  to  a  prior  TWAS  study  focusing  on TSH (30),  our  expanded  study  involved  a  much  larger underlying GWAS  and incorporated PWAS  of the plasma  proteome,  revealing  a  comprehensive  set  of transcripts and proteins associated with both TSH and FT4 levels. Our results confirmed most of the previously reported associations but also revealed new ones, thus contributing  to  a  broader  understanding  of  thyroid function and expanding current knowledge.\n\nWe specifically selected those tissues in which genes that influence thyroid status and disease are predominantly expressed. For TWAS, we, therefore, focused on tissues within the HPT axis (2), namely hypothalamic, pituitary, and thyroid tissue, to examine thyroid hormone production,  as  well  as  whole  blood,  which  gives  a systemic  view  and  can  capture  genetic  influences  on thyroid  function  that  might  be  reflected  in  peripheral tissues. Most  of  the  significant  transcripts  for  both TSH  and  FT4  were  found  in  the  thyroid,  which  may partially be  attributable  to  a  higher  availability  of transcript  models  for  thyroid  TWAS  due  to  a  larger eQTL sample size for the thyroid compared to the hypothalamus  and  pituitary  in  the  GTEx  data. Additionally, it should  be  noted  that the observed number of transcripts associated in the thyroid with  TSH  and  FT4  cannot  be  directly  compared  to hypothalamus  and  pituitary  tissue,  as  the  latter  two have  a  more  complex  cell  type  composition  and  play a  role  in  regulating  different  hormones  (31).  Namely, the  hypothalamus  has  a  complex  and  heterogeneous population of neurons and glial cells that regulate also other endocrine axes, which can affect thyroid-related gene  expression  (32).  Similarly,  the  pituitary  gland  is composed  of  different  hormone-producing  cell  types, with  TSH-secreting  thyrotropes  making  up  less  than 10% of the cells in the gland (33).\n\nOur  results  also  underline  the  link  between  thyroid hormones  and  trace  elements  by  identifying  not  only DIO1  and  DIO2  but  also  the  Se  transport  receptor LRP8 and the selenoprotein-specific translational regulator SECISBP2L. These findings are not only consistent  with  the  well-studied  role  of  iodine  but also selenium in thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism (34, 35). This points toward potential tissue-specific links, motivating further studies in experimental models.\n\n## CAPZB - different SNPs related to different tissues\n\nSix  independent  variants  in  the CAPZB locus  were identified  in  the  TSH  GWAS.  Of  these,  the  intronic SNPs  rs12042004  and  rs10799824  upstream  of CAPZB colocalize  with  gene  expression  in  the  hypothalamus and thyroid, respectively. In agreement with a potential regulatory  role  in  the  thyroid,  rs10799824  maps  into an open chromatin peak in the thyroid but not in other studied  tissues. CAPZB encodes  the  \u03b2-subunit  of  the capping  protein  involved  in  TSH-induced  engulfment of  the  colloid  by  extension  of  microvilli  and  filopodia, representing a key step for thyroglobulin mobilization and subsequent proteolysis of thyroid hormones, including T3 and T4, in the thyroid gland (36). Given the location of rs10799824 in the thyroidspecific  open  chromatin  peak,  it  could  affect  thyroidspecific  gene  expression  of CAPZB ,  e.g.  via  differential transcription  factor  binding,  leading  to  differences  in the  amount  of  produced  thyroid  hormones.  In  turn, these  differences  could  cause  changes  in  the  observed variation of TSH via the negative feedback mechanism by T3 and T4.\n\n## Annexin A5 function in thyroid hormone production\n\nWe described a conceptual model regarding the function of annexin A5 in thyroid hormone production based  on  the  inverse  association  of  TSH  levels  and ANXA5 expression in thyroid and other HPT-axis tissues. A reverse association, namely an effect of TSH levels  on  annexin  A5  levels,  has  also  been  described: previous literature in pigs and rats have shown that  annexin  A5  levels  are  dependent  on  the  cAMP pathway  in  thyroid  cells,  and  that  concentrations  and localization of annexin proteins are under TSH control via this similar pathway, resulting in higher expression of  annexins  mediated  by  TSH-induced  cAMP  (37,  38). Conversely, TSH-stimulated thyroid cells from rats were inversely associated with ANXA5 expression (39 ).  Our  study  also  showed  novel  findings  regarding ANXA5 expression  in  the  other  HPT-axis  tissues  and whole blood, as well as a relation of annexin A5 plasma levels  with  lower  TSH  levels  and  higher  FT4  and  FT3 levels. Recent  studies supporting  these associations of ANXA5 expression  and  protein  levels  on  TSH  levels in  thyroid-related  tissues  are  sparse.  However,  given the  tight  relation  between  the  different  tissues  in  the HPT-axis, it can be expected that the associations with TSH  (and  FT4)  are  present  also  in  hypothalamic  and pituitary tissue, but that these are driven by the effect of ANXA5 in the thyroid. The PWAS findings are consistent with  the  high  abundance  of  annexin  A5  in  plasma as a reflection of the general function of annexins.\n\n## PheWAS supports the relation of PCSK1 to FT4 levels\n\nPheWAS of thyroid function-associated genes identified by  PWAS  revealed  associations  between  rare  genetic variants in PCSK1 and several anthropometric phenotypes, as well as association with PYY, a hormone related to appetite regulation. Rare mutations in PCSK1 are  known  to  result  in  a  loss  of  the  encoded enzyme's  autocatalytic  cleavage  ability,  leading  to  a variable pleiotropic syndrome that can include obesity (40), malabsorption diarrhea, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, growth hormone  deficiency, altered thyroid and  adrenal  function, or impaired  glucose regulation  (28, 41). With  regard  to  altered  thyroid function,  patients  with PCSK1 mutations  demonstrate (mild) central hypothyroidism with low FT4 levels and normal  to  low  TSH  levels.  This  is  in  agreement  with our  PWAS  findings  that  show  a  significant  association between PCSK1 -encoded plasma protein levels and  FT4  levels,  denoting  that  both  rare  and  common variants  in  the  gene  relate  to  functions  of  the  thyroid (Supplementary Tables 8 and 11).\n\n## Study strengths and limitations\n\nTWAS  and  PWAS  are  important  approaches  for  genebased prioritization and for delivering potential mechanistic information by revealing a possible correlation between gene expression or protein levels  and  a  trait.  As  exemplified  in  this  study  on  TSH and  FT4,  which  are  key  players  in  the  HPT-axis,  this approach  could  also  be  of  interest  to  other  axes  in endocrinology.  Similarly,  combining  TWAS  and  PWAS with  available  GWAS  data  could  be  used  to  identify the molecular underpinnings of endocrine circuits. For instance,  cortisol,  a  key  player  in  the  hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis (42), or GWAS data of luteinizing hormone  and follicle-stimulating hormone  as part of  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal  axis  (43),  can provide  valuable  insights  into  the  underlying  genetic architecture. However, it is important to keep in mind that co-regulation of gene expression or protein levels, as well as predicted expression correlations and shared variants between expression weight models, can induce bias  and therefore lead to false positive signals (7). To mitigate  this  potential  bias,  we  included  a  conditional colocalization analysis step and confirmed that several candidate transcripts and proteins revealed by the TWAS and PWAS have a shared causal variant with TSH and FT4 levels. Additionally, the ability of TWAS and PWAS approaches  to  establish  directionality  in  the  observed associations  is  limited.  While  these  approaches  enable the identification of potential  causal  links  between genetically regulated transcript and protein levels with TSH and FT4 levels, it  does  not  ascertain  which  is  the cause  and  which  is  the  consequence.  Experimental\n\nvalidations are needed to unravel the temporal sequence of these associations accurately.\n\nTaking  into  account  the  importance  of  T3  in  thyroid function,  larger  GWAS  on  this  hormone  are  needed  to also  include  T3  as  an  outcome  in  powerful  PWAS  and TWAS  analyses.  Lastly,  the  underlying  GWAS  solely incorporated information from individuals of European descent. We used matching transcript and protein level models  derived  from  persons  of  European  ancestry, but our findings may therefore not be generalizable to other ancestries.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn  summary,  we  performed  well-powered  association studies of genetically inferred, tissue-specific transcripts as well as plasma  protein  levels  with  the  thyroid function parameters TSH and FT4 levels. We identified novel thyroid function-associated genes, including those outside significant GWAS  loci. Tissue-specific colocalization  analysis  revealed  associations  between a  thyroid-specific  regulatory  variant,  rs10799824,  and CAPZB levels. Furthermore, we developed a conceptual framework consistent with the calcium channel activity  of  annexin  A5  in  thyroid  cells,  revealed  by inverse,  colocalization-supported  associations  between ANXA5 transcript  and  protein  levels  with  TSH  levels. Our  findings contribute to a better understanding of transcriptional regulation and protein levels relevant  to  thyroid  hormone  regulation.  Finally,  our approach  can  be  used  as  a  conceptual  blueprint  for other endocrine axes.\n\n## Supplementary materials\n\nThis is linked to the online version of the paper at https://doi.org/10.1530/ ETJ-24-0067.\n\n## Declaration of interest\n\nMM is on the Editorial Board of European Thyroid Journal .

They are regulated via the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and have a heritable component. Using genetic information, we applied tissue-specific transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and plasma proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) to elucidate gene products related to thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels.\n\nResults: TWAS identified 297 and 113 transcripts associated with TSH and FT4 levels, respectively (25 shared), including transcripts not identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these traits, demonstrating the increased power of this approach. Testing for genetic colocalization revealed a shared genetic basis of 158 transcripts with TSH and 45 transcripts with FT4, including independent, FT4-associated genetic signals within the CAPZB locus that were differentially associated with CAPZB expression in different tissues. PWAS identified 18 and ten proteins associated with TSH and FT4, respectively (HEXIM1 and QSOX2 with both). Among these, the cognate genes of five TSH- and 7 FT4-associated proteins mapped outside significant GWAS loci. Colocalization was observed for five plasma proteins each with TSH and FT4. There were ten TSH and one FT4-related gene(s) significant in both TWAS and PWAS. Of these, ANXA5 expression and plasma annexin A5 levels were inversely associated with TSH (PWAS: P = 1.18 \u00d7 10 -13 , TWAS: P = 7.61 \u00d7 10 -12 (whole blood), P = 6.40 \u00d7 10 -13 (hypothalamus), P = 1.57 \u00d7 10 -15 (pituitary), P = 4.27 \u00d7 10 -15 (thyroid)), supported by colocalizations.\n\nConclusion : Our analyses revealed new thyroid function-associated genes and prioritized candidates in known GWAS loci, contributing to a better understanding of transcriptional regulation and protein levels relevant to thyroid function.\n\nKeywords: TWAS; PWAS; HPT axis; thyroid; hypothalamus; pituitary; TSH; FT4; colocalization; metabolism\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Introduction\n\nThyroid hormones (TH) affect cellular metabolism and thereby have vital functions for growth and metabolic homeostasis  (1).  Thyroid  function  is  governed  by  the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid  (HPT)  axis,  where  the thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus stimulates  the  release  of  thyrotropin  (TSH)  from  the anterior  pituitary  gland,  which  in  turn  results  in  the production of the main hormones of the thyroid gland, thyroxine (T4) and  triiodothyronine (T3). Feedback loops  at different levels of the HPT  axis  maintain stable  thyroid  function.  Many  of  the  important  genes involved  in  the  HPT  axis  have  been  uncovered  by  the study  of  monogenic  disorders  of  thyroid  function  (2, 3). However,  important  new  knowledge  remains  to be  uncovered,  as  evidenced  by  recent  GWAS  of  TSH and free T4 (FT4) levels that identified both a new TH transport  protein  encoded  by SLC17A4, as  well  as  a previously unknown TH-metabolizing enzyme encoded by AADAT (4).  Hypothesis-generating screens based on genetic  information  are  therefore  suitable  to  identify and  prioritize  previously  unknown  players  in  thyroid function. A dedicated analysis of all known TH-regulating genes  (5)  moreover  revealed  that  variants  in  these genes detected by GWAS only accounted for a small percentage of variation in thyroid function measures.  This  suggests  the  presence  of  undiscovered TH-regulating genes within the HPT axis. A recent largescale GWAS  meta-analysis  investigated  the  genetics of  thyroid  function  parameters  such  as  TSH,  FT4,  and T3-related  traits  (6).  The  current  study  builds  on  this GWAS  and  investigates  the  two  most  commonly  used thyroid function markers, TSH and FT4, which were also the focus of previous GWAS on thyroid function (4).\n\nAs a genome-wide screen, GWAS needs to be stringently corrected  for  multiple  tests,  which  can  result  in  the missing of true association signals. Moreover, significant GWAS  loci  often  contain  several  genes,  complicating the  prioritization  of  the  causal  gene.  Lastly,  GWAS  do not  provide  information  about  tissue-specific  effects, although most common genetic variants implicated by GWAS are intronic or intergenic and may differentially affect gene expression. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)  can  address  these  three  challenges by  studying  the  effect  of  genetically  predicted,  tissuespecific differential gene expression on a disease or trait of  interest  (7,  8).  TWAS  utilizes  genomic  information associated with a specific phenotype (GWAS) and weight matrices, which are computed using SNP-mRNA associations  (expression  quantitative  trait  loci,  eQTL) data for the relevant tissues from GTEx v8 postmortem tissue from donors, acquired from rapid autopsy and  organ  procurement  organizations  (9,  10).  These matrices quantify the relationship between  genetic variants  and  gene  expression  levels.  TWAS  thereby only  needs  to  correct  for  the  number  of  evaluated transcripts  across  tissues  and  directly  implicate  the investigated  gene  product  as  a  molecular  trait  that links genetic variation to the disease or trait of interest. Proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) represent an analogous approach by studying the effect of genetically predicted protein levels, currently focused on the plasma proteome (11). In addition to the advantages of TWAS, PWAS can identify trait correlations with plasma protein levels  that  are  mediated  through  mechanisms  other than their differential gene expression, such as the trans effects of TSH and FT4 on the circulating proteome. This analysis can give us insights into the HPT axis, and to the best of our knowledge, such analyses have not been applied to investigate other endocrine axes.\n\nThe aims of this study were, therefore, to use TWAS and PWAS  to  uncover  additional  thyroid  function-related genes  previously  unreported  in  GWAS,  to  prioritize potentially  causal  genes  in  TSH-  and  FT4-associated GWAS  loci,  to  contrast  different  tissues  of  the  HPT axis, and  to  characterize  the  identified  associations through  a  series  of  downstream  analyses.  Here,  we unravel  new  thyroid  function-related  genes,  reflecting the increased power of TWAS and PWAS analyses, while also  providing  valuable  insights  into  shared  genetic signals  underlying  transcript  and  protein  levels  and thyroid function levels. The  resulting prioritization of genes in GWAS loci contributes to a better understanding  of  the  genetic  architecture  underlying thyroid  hormone  regulation  and  implicated  numerous previously unreported relationships, such as those for ANXA5 transcript and protein levels.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\n\nGWAS  of  inverse  normal  transformed  values  of  free T4  levels  ( n =  119,120 from  37  cohorts)  revealed  85 independent  significant  SNPs  ( Pvalue  &lt;  5  \u00d710 -8 ),  and of  inverse  normal  transformed  TSH  levels  ( n =  271,040 from 46 cohorts) resulted in 259 independent significant SNPs. All study participants were of European ancestry. Individual study files were filtered by  MAF  &gt;  0.005  and  by  imputation  quality  &gt;  0.4  at the  marker  level.  For  the  meta-analysis,  SNPs  with minor  allele  frequency  (MAF)  &lt;  0.01  or  SNPs  present in &lt;75% of the sample size were excluded. GWAS were performed using genome assembly hg37. Variant identifiers (rsIDs) were annotated and genomic positions were converted to genome assembly GRCh38 (hg38) using the liftOver function from the rtracklayer R package (12).\n\n## Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)\n\nTWAS were performed following the FUSION workflow (13) based on weights from GTEx v8 tissues (European ancestry) considered relevant for thyroid function\n\n(brain hypothalamus,  pituitary, thyroid, and  whole blood). Gene expression weights and linkage disequilibrium (LD) reference data for persons of European  (EUR)  ancestry  from  1000  Genomes  Project (1000G) were downloaded from http://gusevlab.org/ projects/fusion/. Prediction models were based on elastic net modeling (13). Multiple testing was accounted for  by  a  Bonferroni  adjustment  for  the  number  of unique  transcripts  modeled  across  traits  and  tissues ( P -value &lt; 1.74 \u00d7 10 -6 =  0.05/28,768 transcripts). FT3 TWAS was  performed  for  a  selected  candidate  gene, ANXA5 . Overlap  with  significant  GWAS  loci  was  determined using GWAS variants with P -value &lt; 5 \u00d7 10 -8 in a 250 kb window around the TWAS gene.\n\n## Proteome-wide association studies (PWAS)\n\nPWAS  were  performed  based  on  an  adapted  version of  the  FUSION  workflow  ( 13)  using  plasma  protein weights from the European ancestry (EA) subpopulation of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study ( n =  7213)  (ARIC)  (11),  where  plasma  protein  levels  had been  measured  using  the  aptamer-based  Somascan technology (V.4.1 platform). Protein weights and LD reference files were downloaded from http:// nilanjanchatterjeelab.org/pwas/. Prediction models were based on elastic net modeling (13). Multiple testing was accounted for by a Bonferroni adjustment for the number  of  unique  aptamers  modeled  across  traits ( P -value  &lt;  3.78  \u00d7  10 -5 =  0.05  /  1322  aptamers).  Overlap with significant GWAS  loci was determined using GWAS  variants  with P -value  &lt;5  \u00d7  10 -8 in  a  250  kb window around the PWAS gene.\n\n## Conditionally independent colocalization analysis\n\nA  colocalization  analysis  of  independent  signals  was performed for each significant association. Colocalization of TWAS findings was performed using publicly available cis -eQTL  summary  statistics  from  GTEx  v8 (EUR). For PWAS, we used cis -protein quantitative trait loci  (pQTL) summary statistics from EA participants of the  ARIC  study  (11 ).  As  LD  reference  data,  we  used  a subset  of  15,000  genomically  British  participants  from the  UK  Biobank  (application  number  20272);  genomic positions were converted to genome assembly GRCh38 (hg38) using the liftOver function from the rtracklayer R  package  (12).  Plasma  proteins  and  gene  expression summary  statistics were extracted for every gene significant  by  TWAS  or  PWAS  with  a  250  kb  flanking region.  First,  independent  association  signals  within these  regions  were  identified  based  on  approximate conditional  analyses  via  the  GCTA  COJO-Slct  algorithm (14),  with default parameters ( P -value &lt; 5 \u00d7 10 -8 and a collinearity of 0.9). For each conditionally independent SNP,  conditional  summary  statistics  were  computed by  conditioning  on  all  other  independent  SNPs  in  the gene region using the GCTA COJO-Cond algorithm with default parameters (collinearity of 0.9) (14). Subsequently, approximate Bayes factors-based colocalization analyses were conducted for all pairwise combinations of independent  eQTL/pQTL  associations  against  the independent thyroid function GWAS associations (15)  using  an  adapted  version  of  the  Giambartolomei colocalization  method  as  implemented  in  the  'coloc. fast' function (https://github.com/tobyjohnson/gtx), with default  parameters  and  prior  definitions  ( 16).  Positive colocalizations were reported if the posterior probability of a shared causal variant (PPH4/p12) was \u22650.8.\n\n## GO, KEGG, and tissue enrichment analyses\n\nEnrichment  testing  of  the  significant  genes  identified by  TWAS for TSH (297 genes) and for FT4 (113 genes) was performed in different resources using gene ontology  (GO)  terms  (17),  Kyoto  encyclopedia  of  genes and  genomes  (KEGG)  pathways  (18),  Human  protein atlas  (HPA)  tissues  (19),  and  GTEx  v8  tissues  (9),  with highly  expressed  genes  in  each  tissue  defined  as  the top 10% most highly expressed genes. For more details on  the  processing  of  the  tissue  resources,  see  ref.  20. For  all  enrichment  analyses,  we  used  hypergeometric tests implemented  in  the  R  package  clusterProfiler version 4.0.5 (21), where we selected the overlap of the 15,422  genes  encoding  for  transcripts  analyzed  during TWAS  with the genes available in the respective resource as background genes. When testing for enrichment  in  GO  terms  and  KEGG  pathways,  after overlapping with the available genes in the respective resource,  the  gene  set  originating  from  TSH  contained 186 and 95 genes, the gene set originating from FT4  contained  76  and  38  genes,  and  the  number  of background  genes  was  reduced  to  9629  and  4339, respectively. When performing tissue-specific enrichment analyses, the gene set  assigned  to  a  tissue was  filtered  for  genes  encoding  transcripts  analyzed during  TWAS.  All  results  were  filtered  for  terms  with at least two genes. P -values were corrected for multiple testing  using  the  Benjamini-Hochberg  procedure  (22) separately in each of the different resources.\n\n## Investigation of significant genes for associations with human traits and diseases through PheWAS\n\nWe  performed  queries  of  phenome-wide  association results  using  the  AstraZeneca  PheWAS  Portal.  These results  are  based  on  the  UK  Biobank  whole-exome sequencing  data  (469,809  UK  Biobank  exomes)  and contain associations for phenotypes derived from electronic health records, questionnaire data, and continuous  traits  released  by  UK  Biobank  (23).  We limited our queries to gene-level associations to directly  link  them  with  genes  detected  in  our  TWAS (385  genes)  and  PWAS  (28  genes).  Gene-level  analyses\n\nwere  based  on  collapsing  analyses,  which  aggregated rare, putatively deleterious, qualifying variants in each gene  with  given  criteria,  including  ten  dominant  and one recessive model, and testing them against a given phenotype. P -values for binary traits associations were determined by Fisher's exact two-sided test, and P -values for quantitative traits were determined by linear regression corrected for age, sex, and their interaction (age \u00d7 sex). We considered all available binary endpoints ( n =  10,088) and quantitative endpoints ( n =  1927). The total number  of  unique  phenotypes  was n =  14,956. Therefore, we defined the following significance thresholds  for  our  queries: P -value  &lt;  1.19  \u00d7  10 -7 (0.05 /  (28  genes  \u00d7  14,956  phenotypes))  for  genes  implicated by PWAS, and P -value &lt; 8.68 \u00d7 10 -9 (0.05 / (385 genes \u00d7 14,956 phenotypes)) for those implicated by TWAS. The queries  were  further  filtered  to  retain  binary  traits with more than 100 cases and controls and continuous traits  with  more  than  30  observations.  Additionally, the number of cases or controls with qualifying variants  in binary  phenotypes  and  the  number  of participants  with  qualifying  variants  in  quantitative phenotypes had to exceed 3.\n\n## Results\n\n## TWAS reveal expressed genes related to thyroid hormone metabolism\n\nWe performed an HPT axis tissue-specific TWAS based  on  gene  expression  models  derived  from  GTEx project v8 data (Supplementary Table 1, see section on supplementary materials given at the end of this article) (9,  13)  and  GWAS  summary  statistics  of  TSH  and  FT4 derived  from  up  to  271,040  individuals  of  European ancestry across 46 predominantly  population-based cohorts  from  the  ThyroidOmics  Consortium  (Fig.  1). Each transcript was predicted using tissue-specific gene  expression  information,  which  allowed  for  the identification  of  genetic  variants  associated  with  gene expression levels in the relevant tissue (i.e. hypothalamus, pituitary,  thyroid,  and  whole  blood).  Across  tissues, TWAS  yielded  297  and  113  transcripts  significantly associated  with  TSH  and  FT4,  respectively  (Fig.  2).  A total of 25  transcripts  were  significantly  associated with both hormones. Of these, 20 transcripts exhibited inverse  associations,  meaning  that  their  correlation with TSH was opposite to that with FT4 (Supplementary Fig. 1A and Supplementary  Table 2). The thyroid gland yielded the highest number of significant findings across all studied tissues, accounting  for  76.8%  of significant findings from TWAS of TSH and 64.6% from TWAS  of  FT4  (Fig.  2,  Supplementary  Fig.  1B,  C  and Supplementary Table 2).\n\nFrom  the  297  unique  transcripts  associated  with  TSH in one or more tissues, 24 were not encoded by a gene mapping into a significant GWAS  locus. Likewise, the  genes  encoding  14  out  of  the  113  significant  FT4associated  transcripts  did  not  map  into  a  significant\n\nGWAS  locus  (Methods,  Supplementary  Table  2).  Thus, TWAS enabled a gain in power to detect novel thyroid function-associated signals due to the reduced multiple testing  burden  of  gene-based  analysis  as  opposed  to variant-based analysis.\n\nTo assess whether the implicated transcripts represented a molecular link between genetic variation and  TSH  or  FT4  levels  or  independent  associations  in the  same  genetic  region,  we  performed  conditional genetic colocalization analyses. Strong  evidence  for colocalization, i.e. the posterior probability of a shared underlying  causal  variant  (PPH4  &gt;  0.8;  Methods),  was identified  between  thyroid  function  (GWAS)  and  gene expression for 158 (TSH) and 45 (FT4) transcripts in at least  one  of  the  studied  tissues  (Fig.  2,  Supplementary Figs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and Supplementary Table 3). These colocalization  results  are  consistent  with  regions  in which regulatory  variants  affect  both  gene  expression and thyroid function, thereby enabling the prioritization of potentially causal genes in the GWAS loci.\n\nReassuringly,  significant  findings  from  TWAS  of  TSH and FT4 contained multiple positive controls, i.e., transcripts encoded by genes known to have important roles in thyroid hormone  regulation.  For  example, TPO , encoding  the  TH-synthesizing  enzyme  thyroid peroxidase, and PDE8B , encoding phosphodiesterase 8B that catalyzes cAMP hydrolysis, a key second messenger in  TSH  signaling,  were  associated  with  both  TSH  and FT4. Testing for colocalization confirmed  a  shared genetic signal underlying both higher thyroid TPO and PDE8B expression  and  higher  levels  of  TSH,  as  well as  lower  levels  of  FT4  (Supplementary  Fig.  10).  In  line with  known  physiology,  the  colocalization  of  TSH  and FT4 GWAS signals with gene expression was present in thyroid  tissue,  but  not  in  the  hypothalamus,  pituitary, or whole blood. Along the same lines, the colocalization of  transcript  levels  of  the  TSH  receptor  encoding  for the gene TSHR with  TSH was present solely in thyroid tissue. This finding is in line with the fact that the TSH receptor is  predominantly expressed (9) and exerts its main function on the thyroid, as the TWAS of FT4 did not show a significant association (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 3).\n\n## Tissue-specific differential CAPZB expression links independent genetic variants to altered TSH levels\n\nWe  observed  a  significant  association  for CAPZB in both  thyroid-specific  ( P -value = 2.02  \u00d7  10 -215 )  as  well  as pituitary-specific  ( P -value = 1.57  \u00d7  10 -15 )  TWAS  of  TSH (Fig. 3). CAPZB expression models were unavailable for hypothalamus-  and  whole  blood-specific  TWAS  due  to the lack of significant heritability of the eQTL in these datasets. Nevertheless, colocalization analyses between GWAS and  gene  expression  could  be  conducted  in  all HPT  tissues. These  analyses  revealed  colocalization between  genetically higher TSH  levels and higher levels of CAPZB expression in both thyroid (PPH4 = 0.99)\n\nFigure 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWorkflow of integrated transcriptome and proteome-wide association studies of thyroid hormones TSH and FT4.\n\nand  hypothalamus  (PPH4 = 0.89).  A  moderately  strong colocalization  signal  (PPH4 = 0.75)  between  genetically higher TSH levels and higher levels of CAPZB expression in the pituitary was also identified. Interestingly, independent  TSH-associated  genetic  variants  seemed to differentially modulate CAPZB expression in a tissuedependent  manner,  as  shown  in  Fig.  3A:  whereas  a TSH-associated  genetic  signal  upstream  of CAPZB also underlies differential CAPZB expression in the thyroid, another  independent  genetic  signal  centered  on  the gene  body  underlies  differential CAPZB expression  in hypothalamus.\n\nTo further substantiate the regulatory potential of these  variants,  we  analyzed  functional  genomics  data from  thyroid  tissue  generated  by  the  ENCODE  Project Consortium and found that rs10799824, the implicated variant  upstream  of CAPZB , overlapped  with  open chromatin  (ATAC-seq).  Notably,  this  position  was  not accessible in other tissues from the same tissue donor (ENCDO451RUA)  ( Fig. 3B ), supporting tissue-specific regulatory  function.  These  findings  were  confirmed in  thyroid  tissue  of  a  different  donor  (ENCDO793LXB) (Methods,  Supplementary  Fig.  11A).  We  looked  into PheWeb using 1400 EHR-derived broad phenome-\n\nA\n\nB\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Figure 2\n\nResults of tissue-specific TWAS analyses.

To investigate potential relationships between the genes identified through our TWAS approach and rare damaging  variants  associated with thyroid disease, we  investigated  the  individual  and  aggregated  effects of  rare,  putatively  damaging  genetic  variants  across the exome using whole-exome sequencing and clinical  outcome  data  from  the  UK  Biobank  (23),  as implemented in the AZ Portal (Methods).  Our  analysis revealed  significant  associations  for  the  TSH  receptor gene with endocrine  and  metabolic diseases, such as hypothyroidism.  We  identified  other  associations described  in  Supplementary  Fig.  12,  Supplementary Tables 4 and 5.\n\n## Pathway enrichment for TWAS findings\n\nWe  next  performed  overrepresentation  analyses  for genes  encoding  for  significantly  associated  transcripts from  TWAS  using  GO  and  KEGG  databases  to  identify enriched pathways (Methods). For TSH, enriched biological processes (GO) and metabolic pathways (KEGG) were related to growth factors, cAMPmediated  signaling,  and  cAMP  biosynthetic  process. Additionally,  genes  encoding  for  associated  transcripts were  overrepresented  in  morphine  addiction,  relaxin signaling pathway, dopaminergic synapse, and chemical carcinogenesis, among others (Supplementary Fig. 13A and Supplementary Table 6). For FT4, enriched molecular functions  and  biological  processes  (GO),  as  well  as metabolic pathways (KEGG), were related to metabolic processes,  thyroid  hormone  generation,  metabolism, and signaling, as well as chemical carcinogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 13B and Supplementary Table 6).\n\nOverrepresentation analyses to identify tissues in which  the  target  transcripts  were  highly  expressed (Methods)  revealed  thyroid  tissue  for  both  TSH  and FT4  and  additionally  minor  salivary  gland  for  TSH (Supplementary Table 7). These results provide evidence  that  transcripts  implicated  by  TWAS  of  TSH and  FT4  are  indeed  involved  in  molecular  pathways that  are  relevant  to  thyroid  function  and  molecular metabolism, including TSH and FT4 regulation.\n\n## PWAS reveal plasma proteins related to thyroid function\n\nPWAS revealed significant associations between genetically predicted levels of 18 plasma proteins\n\n(Methods)  with  TSH  and  10  with  FT4.  Two  proteins, protein HEXIM1 and Sulfhydryl oxidase 2 (QSOX2), were associated with both hormones (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig.  14A  and  Supplementary  Table  8).  Evidence  for  a shared  causal  variant  from  colocalization  testing  was observed  for  five  TSH-  and  five  FT4-related  proteins (Supplementary Table 9). Although HEXIM1 and Sulfhydryl  oxidase  2  were  not  among  the  proteins  for which  colocalization  was  observed,  dedicated  testing for colocalization with gene expression showed  a shared genetic signal underlying FT4 levels and QSOX2 expression  in  both  thyroid  and  pituitary  (PPH4 = 0.969 and 0.968, respectively).\n\nFrom all significant plasma proteins detected by PWAS  of  thyroid  function,  the  genes  encoding  for  5 and  7  proteins  did  not  map  into  a  significant  GWAS locus for TSH  and  FT4,  respectively  (see  Methods, Supplementary  Table  8).  Details  about  the  function  of these novel TH-related candidates are summarized in  Supplementary  Table  10  (TSH)  and  Supplementary Table 11 (FT4).\n\nThere  were  11  significant  shared  findings  between PWAS  and  TWAS:  10  with  TWAS  of  TSH,  including HEXIM1,  and  one  with  TWAS  of  FT4  (Supplementary Fig.  14B  and  C),  providing  evidence  for  a  molecular chain  connecting  genetic  variation,  gene  expression, and protein levels with thyroid function. In particular, ANXA5  (annexin  A5)  showed  colocalization  between TSH-associated genetic variants with both their plasma protein  and  their  gene  expression  levels  in  HPT  axis tissues (Supplementary Table 12).\n\n## Annexin A5 is inversely associated with TSH levels\n\nWe observed a significant inverse association between plasma levels of  annexin  A5  and  TSH  (PWAS P -value =  1.18 \u00d7 10 -13 ), and an inverse association between TSH and ANXA5 expression in the hypothalamus (TWAS P -value = 6.40 \u00d7 10 -13 ), pituitary (TWAS P -value = 1.57  \u00d7  10 -15 ),  thyroid  (TWAS P -value = 4.27  \u00d7  10 -15 ), and  whole  blood  (TWAS P -value = 7.61  \u00d7  10 -12 ).  These findings  were  supported  by  colocalization  testing:  we observed  colocalization  between  TSH  GWAS  and  both annexin A5 plasma protein levels and gene expression in  all  studied  tissues,  with  lower  TSH  levels  related to  higher  protein  and  expression  levels.  In  line  with these  findings,  colocalization  between  plasma  protein and  gene  expression  levels  was  also  observed  with  a positive correlation (Fig. 5A).\n\nAnnexin A5 (Anxa A5, annexin V) is a member of the Ca 2+ -dependent phospholipid-binding protein family of annexins,  functioning  as  a  membrane  stabilizer. Once the membrane is bound, the function of annexins can vary: some members of the annexin family act in vesicle  trafficking  or  membrane  organization  ( 1,  25). Furthermore,  annexins,  including  annexin  A5,  have been  described  to  function  as  a  Ca 2+   channel  under certain conditions (25 ).  The  latter  finding  is  of  interest\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Figure 4\n\nResults of plasma PWAS analyses.

(B) Simplified conceptual model of annexin A5 exhibiting calcium channel activity in thyroid cells. Calcium is required for the H202 formation in the iodination process in the presence of NADPH, O2, dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2), and thyroid peroxidase (TPO). Subsequently, iodination of tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin (TG) takes place to form, after coupling, the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. * indicates a significant association found in TWAS.

Image created with BioRender .com.\n\nbecause  calcium  is  required  in  the  iodination  process and H2O2 production to form thyroid hormones (1). Additionally, a previous  study  showed  that  on continuous  daily  administration  of  calcium  channel blockers, a gradual fall in levels of T3 and T4 with a rise in TSH levels was observed in rabbits (26). Our results showed a positive although non-significant association between  FT4  and  FT3  levels  and ANXA5 expression in  the  thyroid  (TWAS P -value = 1.27  \u00d7  10 -02 and  TWAS P -value = 1.02  \u00d7  10 -01 , respectively),  and  a  significant inverse  relation  between  thyroid ANXA5 expression levels and  TSH,  consistent with  stimulation of TH production  in  presence  of  annexin  A5  and  displaying the negative feedback loop (Fig. 5b).\n\n## Connecting PWAS discoveries to rare thyroid-related variants using PheWAS\n\nWe  investigated whether  rare putatively damaging variants in the cognate genes of plasma proteins identified in PWAS  showed  significant associations across  a  broad  range  of  clinical  traits  and  diseases. We identified potential connections between rare variants in the genes encoding for plasma protein levels whose  predicted  levels  were  significantly  associated with  thyroid  traits  in  PWAS  (Supplementary  Fig.  15, Supplementary  Tables 13 and 14). Gene-phenotype associations were observed for PSCK1 (from FT4 analyses) with higher fat mass, weight, and phenotypes related to body mass index. Additionally, plasma levels of peptide YY (PYY), a gut hormone involved in appetite regulation and obesity, were also associated with PSCK1 (27). PSCK1 encodes the prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), a serine endoprotease responsible for processing precursor proteins as pro-neuropeptides and  prohormones  (28).  Moreover, IHH identified  by PWAS of FT4, was associated with respiratory function and  height-related  phenotypes.  It  encodes  a  signaling molecule  associated  with  the  regulation  of  skeletal growth  and  development,  phenotypes  influenced  by thyroid  hormones.  Lastly, HGFAC , which  encodes  a protease  that  activates  the  hepatocyte  growth  factor hormone  revealed  in  the  FT4  PWAS,  was  associated with  sex  hormone-binding  globulin  (SHBG).  Thyroid hormones  (T3  and  T4)  were  shown  to  act  indirectly to  increase  SHBG  production  in  the  liver  (29),  and could thus be part of the pathway from HGFAC expression to SHBG levels.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis  systematic  study  of  the  relation  of  genetically predicted tissue-specific levels of gene expression and  the  plasma  proteome  with  the  most  commonly quantified thyroid function-related hormones, TSH and FT4,  has  several  principal  findings:  first,  we  identified thyroid function-associated transcripts and  proteins that are missed by conventional GWAS even at sample sizes well over 250,000 individuals. Secondly, the analyses can help prioritize genes in GWAS  loci, including previously identified loci. Thirdly, conditional colocalization analyses increased confidence in candidates  that  share  a  genetic  basis  with  TH  and provided information about tissue-specific and tissue-shared  effects  on  gene  expression.  Functional annotation of candidate variants implicated a potentially causal,  TSH-related  regulatory  variant  driving CAPZB expression  in  the thyroid. Fourthly, shared  genetic causes of transcript, protein, and TSH levels support the role of annexin A5 in TH regulation.\n\nIn  comparison  to  a  prior  TWAS  study  focusing  on TSH (30),  our  expanded  study  involved  a  much  larger underlying GWAS  and incorporated PWAS  of the plasma  proteome,  revealing  a  comprehensive  set  of transcripts and proteins associated with both TSH and FT4 levels. Our results confirmed most of the previously reported associations but also revealed new ones, thus contributing  to  a  broader  understanding  of  thyroid function and expanding current knowledge.\n\nWe specifically selected those tissues in which genes that influence thyroid status and disease are predominantly expressed. For TWAS, we, therefore, focused on tissues within the HPT axis (2), namely hypothalamic, pituitary, and thyroid tissue, to examine thyroid hormone production,  as  well  as  whole  blood,  which  gives  a systemic  view  and  can  capture  genetic  influences  on thyroid  function  that  might  be  reflected  in  peripheral tissues. Most  of  the  significant  transcripts  for  both TSH  and  FT4  were  found  in  the  thyroid,  which  may partially be  attributable  to  a  higher  availability  of transcript  models  for  thyroid  TWAS  due  to  a  larger eQTL sample size for the thyroid compared to the hypothalamus  and  pituitary  in  the  GTEx  data. Additionally, it should  be  noted  that the observed number of transcripts associated in the thyroid with  TSH  and  FT4  cannot  be  directly  compared  to hypothalamus  and  pituitary  tissue,  as  the  latter  two have  a  more  complex  cell  type  composition  and  play a  role  in  regulating  different  hormones  (31).  Namely, the  hypothalamus  has  a  complex  and  heterogeneous population of neurons and glial cells that regulate also other endocrine axes, which can affect thyroid-related gene  expression  (32).  Similarly,  the  pituitary  gland  is composed  of  different  hormone-producing  cell  types, with  TSH-secreting  thyrotropes  making  up  less  than 10% of the cells in the gland (33).\n\nOur  results  also  underline  the  link  between  thyroid hormones  and  trace  elements  by  identifying  not  only DIO1  and  DIO2  but  also  the  Se  transport  receptor LRP8 and the selenoprotein-specific translational regulator SECISBP2L. These findings are not only consistent  with  the  well-studied  role  of  iodine  but also selenium in thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism (34, 35). This points toward potential tissue-specific links, motivating further studies in experimental models.\n\n## CAPZB - different SNPs related to different tissues\n\nSix  independent  variants  in  the CAPZB locus  were identified  in  the  TSH  GWAS.  Of  these,  the  intronic SNPs  rs12042004  and  rs10799824  upstream  of CAPZB colocalize  with  gene  expression  in  the  hypothalamus and thyroid, respectively. In agreement with a potential regulatory  role  in  the  thyroid,  rs10799824  maps  into an open chromatin peak in the thyroid but not in other studied  tissues. CAPZB encodes  the  \u03b2-subunit  of  the capping  protein  involved  in  TSH-induced  engulfment of  the  colloid  by  extension  of  microvilli  and  filopodia, representing a key step for thyroglobulin mobilization and subsequent proteolysis of thyroid hormones, including T3 and T4, in the thyroid gland (36). Given the location of rs10799824 in the thyroidspecific  open  chromatin  peak,  it  could  affect  thyroidspecific  gene  expression  of CAPZB ,  e.g.  via  differential transcription  factor  binding,  leading  to  differences  in the  amount  of  produced  thyroid  hormones.  In  turn, these  differences  could  cause  changes  in  the  observed variation of TSH via the negative feedback mechanism by T3 and T4.\n\n## Annexin A5 function in thyroid hormone production\n\nWe described a conceptual model regarding the function of annexin A5 in thyroid hormone production based  on  the  inverse  association  of  TSH  levels  and ANXA5 expression in thyroid and other HPT-axis tissues. A reverse association, namely an effect of TSH levels  on  annexin  A5  levels,  has  also  been  described: previous literature in pigs and rats have shown that  annexin  A5  levels  are  dependent  on  the  cAMP pathway  in  thyroid  cells,  and  that  concentrations  and localization of annexin proteins are under TSH control via this similar pathway, resulting in higher expression of  annexins  mediated  by  TSH-induced  cAMP  (37,  38). Conversely, TSH-stimulated thyroid cells from rats were inversely associated with ANXA5 expression (39 ).  Our  study  also  showed  novel  findings  regarding ANXA5 expression  in  the  other  HPT-axis  tissues  and whole blood, as well as a relation of annexin A5 plasma levels  with  lower  TSH  levels  and  higher  FT4  and  FT3 levels. Recent  studies supporting  these associations of ANXA5 expression  and  protein  levels  on  TSH  levels in  thyroid-related  tissues  are  sparse.  However,  given the  tight  relation  between  the  different  tissues  in  the HPT-axis, it can be expected that the associations with TSH  (and  FT4)  are  present  also  in  hypothalamic  and pituitary tissue, but that these are driven by the effect of ANXA5 in the thyroid. The PWAS findings are consistent with  the  high  abundance  of  annexin  A5  in  plasma as a reflection of the general function of annexins.\n\n## PheWAS supports the relation of PCSK1 to FT4 levels\n\nPheWAS of thyroid function-associated genes identified by  PWAS  revealed  associations  between  rare  genetic variants in PCSK1 and several anthropometric phenotypes, as well as association with PYY, a hormone related to appetite regulation. Rare mutations in PCSK1 are  known  to  result  in  a  loss  of  the  encoded enzyme's  autocatalytic  cleavage  ability,  leading  to  a variable pleiotropic syndrome that can include obesity (40), malabsorption diarrhea, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, growth hormone  deficiency, altered thyroid and  adrenal  function, or impaired  glucose regulation  (28, 41). With  regard  to  altered  thyroid function,  patients  with PCSK1 mutations  demonstrate (mild) central hypothyroidism with low FT4 levels and normal  to  low  TSH  levels.  This  is  in  agreement  with our  PWAS  findings  that  show  a  significant  association between PCSK1 -encoded plasma protein levels and  FT4  levels,  denoting  that  both  rare  and  common variants  in  the  gene  relate  to  functions  of  the  thyroid (Supplementary Tables 8 and 11).\n\n## Study strengths and limitations\n\nTWAS  and  PWAS  are  important  approaches  for  genebased prioritization and for delivering potential mechanistic information by revealing a possible correlation between gene expression or protein levels  and  a  trait.  As  exemplified  in  this  study  on  TSH and  FT4,  which  are  key  players  in  the  HPT-axis,  this approach  could  also  be  of  interest  to  other  axes  in endocrinology.  Similarly,  combining  TWAS  and  PWAS with  available  GWAS  data  could  be  used  to  identify the molecular underpinnings of endocrine circuits. For instance,  cortisol,  a  key  player  in  the  hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis (42), or GWAS data of luteinizing hormone  and follicle-stimulating hormone  as part of  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal  axis  (43),  can provide  valuable  insights  into  the  underlying  genetic architecture. However, it is important to keep in mind that co-regulation of gene expression or protein levels, as well as predicted expression correlations and shared variants between expression weight models, can induce bias  and therefore lead to false positive signals (7). To mitigate  this  potential  bias,  we  included  a  conditional colocalization analysis step and confirmed that several candidate transcripts and proteins revealed by the TWAS and PWAS have a shared causal variant with TSH and FT4 levels. Additionally, the ability of TWAS and PWAS approaches  to  establish  directionality  in  the  observed associations  is  limited.  While  these  approaches  enable the identification of potential  causal  links  between genetically regulated transcript and protein levels with TSH and FT4 levels, it  does  not  ascertain  which  is  the cause  and  which  is  the  consequence.  Experimental\n\nvalidations are needed to unravel the temporal sequence of these associations accurately.\n\nTaking  into  account  the  importance  of  T3  in  thyroid function,  larger  GWAS  on  this  hormone  are  needed  to also  include  T3  as  an  outcome  in  powerful  PWAS  and TWAS  analyses.  Lastly,  the  underlying  GWAS  solely incorporated information from individuals of European descent. We used matching transcript and protein level models  derived  from  persons  of  European  ancestry, but our findings may therefore not be generalizable to other ancestries.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn  summary,  we  performed  well-powered  association studies of genetically inferred, tissue-specific transcripts as well as plasma  protein  levels  with  the  thyroid function parameters TSH and FT4 levels. We identified novel thyroid function-associated genes, including those outside significant GWAS  loci. Tissue-specific colocalization  analysis  revealed  associations  between a  thyroid-specific  regulatory  variant,  rs10799824,  and CAPZB levels. Furthermore, we developed a conceptual framework consistent with the calcium channel activity  of  annexin  A5  in  thyroid  cells,  revealed  by inverse,  colocalization-supported  associations  between ANXA5 transcript  and  protein  levels  with  TSH  levels. Our  findings contribute to a better understanding of transcriptional regulation and protein levels relevant  to  thyroid  hormone  regulation.  Finally,  our approach  can  be  used  as  a  conceptual  blueprint  for other endocrine axes.\n\n## Supplementary materials\n\nThis is linked to the online version of the paper at https://doi.org/10.1530/ ETJ-24-0067.\n\n## Declaration of interest\n\nMM is on the Editorial Board of European Thyroid Journal .

They are regulated via the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and have a heritable component. Using genetic information, we applied tissue-specific transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and plasma proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) to elucidate gene products related to thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels.\n\nResults: TWAS identified 297 and 113 transcripts associated with TSH and FT4 levels, respectively (25 shared), including transcripts not identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these traits, demonstrating the increased power of this approach. Testing for genetic colocalization revealed a shared genetic basis of 158 transcripts with TSH and 45 transcripts with FT4, including independent, FT4-associated genetic signals within the CAPZB locus that were differentially associated with CAPZB expression in different tissues. PWAS identified 18 and ten proteins associated with TSH and FT4, respectively (HEXIM1 and QSOX2 with both). Among these, the cognate genes of five TSH- and 7 FT4-associated proteins mapped outside significant GWAS loci. Colocalization was observed for five plasma proteins each with TSH and FT4. There were ten TSH and one FT4-related gene(s) significant in both TWAS and PWAS. Of these, ANXA5 expression and plasma annexin A5 levels were inversely associated with TSH (PWAS: P = 1.18 \u00d7 10 -13 , TWAS: P = 7.61 \u00d7 10 -12 (whole blood), P = 6.40 \u00d7 10 -13 (hypothalamus), P = 1.57 \u00d7 10 -15 (pituitary), P = 4.27 \u00d7 10 -15 (thyroid)), supported by colocalizations.\n\nConclusion : Our analyses revealed new thyroid function-associated genes and prioritized candidates in known GWAS loci, contributing to a better understanding of transcriptional regulation and protein levels relevant to thyroid function.\n\nKeywords: TWAS; PWAS; HPT axis; thyroid; hypothalamus; pituitary; TSH; FT4; colocalization; metabolism\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Introduction\n\nThyroid hormones (TH) affect cellular metabolism and thereby have vital functions for growth and metabolic homeostasis  (1).  Thyroid  function  is  governed  by  the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid  (HPT)  axis,  where  the thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus stimulates  the  release  of  thyrotropin  (TSH)  from  the anterior  pituitary  gland,  which  in  turn  results  in  the production of the main hormones of the thyroid gland, thyroxine (T4) and  triiodothyronine (T3). Feedback loops  at different levels of the HPT  axis  maintain stable  thyroid  function.  Many  of  the  important  genes involved  in  the  HPT  axis  have  been  uncovered  by  the study  of  monogenic  disorders  of  thyroid  function  (2, 3). However,  important  new  knowledge  remains  to be  uncovered,  as  evidenced  by  recent  GWAS  of  TSH and free T4 (FT4) levels that identified both a new TH transport  protein  encoded  by SLC17A4, as  well  as  a previously unknown TH-metabolizing enzyme encoded by AADAT (4).  Hypothesis-generating screens based on genetic  information  are  therefore  suitable  to  identify and  prioritize  previously  unknown  players  in  thyroid function. A dedicated analysis of all known TH-regulating genes  (5)  moreover  revealed  that  variants  in  these genes detected by GWAS only accounted for a small percentage of variation in thyroid function measures.  This  suggests  the  presence  of  undiscovered TH-regulating genes within the HPT axis. A recent largescale GWAS  meta-analysis  investigated  the  genetics of  thyroid  function  parameters  such  as  TSH,  FT4,  and T3-related  traits  (6).  The  current  study  builds  on  this GWAS  and  investigates  the  two  most  commonly  used thyroid function markers, TSH and FT4, which were also the focus of previous GWAS on thyroid function (4).\n\nAs a genome-wide screen, GWAS needs to be stringently corrected  for  multiple  tests,  which  can  result  in  the missing of true association signals. Moreover, significant GWAS  loci  often  contain  several  genes,  complicating the  prioritization  of  the  causal  gene.  Lastly,  GWAS  do not  provide  information  about  tissue-specific  effects, although most common genetic variants implicated by GWAS are intronic or intergenic and may differentially affect gene expression. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)  can  address  these  three  challenges by  studying  the  effect  of  genetically  predicted,  tissuespecific differential gene expression on a disease or trait of  interest  (7,  8).  TWAS  utilizes  genomic  information associated with a specific phenotype (GWAS) and weight matrices, which are computed using SNP-mRNA associations  (expression  quantitative  trait  loci,  eQTL) data for the relevant tissues from GTEx v8 postmortem tissue from donors, acquired from rapid autopsy and  organ  procurement  organizations  (9,  10).  These matrices quantify the relationship between  genetic variants  and  gene  expression  levels.  TWAS  thereby only  needs  to  correct  for  the  number  of  evaluated transcripts  across  tissues  and  directly  implicate  the investigated  gene  product  as  a  molecular  trait  that links genetic variation to the disease or trait of interest. Proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) represent an analogous approach by studying the effect of genetically predicted protein levels, currently focused on the plasma proteome (11). In addition to the advantages of TWAS, PWAS can identify trait correlations with plasma protein levels  that  are  mediated  through  mechanisms  other than their differential gene expression, such as the trans effects of TSH and FT4 on the circulating proteome. This analysis can give us insights into the HPT axis, and to the best of our knowledge, such analyses have not been applied to investigate other endocrine axes.\n\nThe aims of this study were, therefore, to use TWAS and PWAS  to  uncover  additional  thyroid  function-related genes  previously  unreported  in  GWAS,  to  prioritize potentially  causal  genes  in  TSH-  and  FT4-associated GWAS  loci,  to  contrast  different  tissues  of  the  HPT axis, and  to  characterize  the  identified  associations through  a  series  of  downstream  analyses.  Here,  we unravel  new  thyroid  function-related  genes,  reflecting the increased power of TWAS and PWAS analyses, while also  providing  valuable  insights  into  shared  genetic signals  underlying  transcript  and  protein  levels  and thyroid function levels. The  resulting prioritization of genes in GWAS loci contributes to a better understanding  of  the  genetic  architecture  underlying thyroid  hormone  regulation  and  implicated  numerous previously unreported relationships, such as those for ANXA5 transcript and protein levels.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\n\nGWAS  of  inverse  normal  transformed  values  of  free T4  levels  ( n =  119,120 from  37  cohorts)  revealed  85 independent  significant  SNPs  ( Pvalue  &lt;  5  \u00d710 -8 ),  and of  inverse  normal  transformed  TSH  levels  ( n =  271,040 from 46 cohorts) resulted in 259 independent significant SNPs. All study participants were of European ancestry. Individual study files were filtered by  MAF  &gt;  0.005  and  by  imputation  quality  &gt;  0.4  at the  marker  level.  For  the  meta-analysis,  SNPs  with minor  allele  frequency  (MAF)  &lt;  0.01  or  SNPs  present in &lt;75% of the sample size were excluded. GWAS were performed using genome assembly hg37. Variant identifiers (rsIDs) were annotated and genomic positions were converted to genome assembly GRCh38 (hg38) using the liftOver function from the rtracklayer R package (12).\n\n## Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)\n\nTWAS were performed following the FUSION workflow (13) based on weights from GTEx v8 tissues (European ancestry) considered relevant for thyroid function\n\n(brain hypothalamus,  pituitary, thyroid, and  whole blood). Gene expression weights and linkage disequilibrium (LD) reference data for persons of European  (EUR)  ancestry  from  1000  Genomes  Project (1000G) were downloaded from http://gusevlab.org/ projects/fusion/. Prediction models were based on elastic net modeling (13). Multiple testing was accounted for  by  a  Bonferroni  adjustment  for  the  number  of unique  transcripts  modeled  across  traits  and  tissues ( P -value &lt; 1.74 \u00d7 10 -6 =  0.05/28,768 transcripts). FT3 TWAS was  performed  for  a  selected  candidate  gene, ANXA5 . Overlap  with  significant  GWAS  loci  was  determined using GWAS variants with P -value &lt; 5 \u00d7 10 -8 in a 250 kb window around the TWAS gene.\n\n## Proteome-wide association studies (PWAS)\n\nPWAS  were  performed  based  on  an  adapted  version of  the  FUSION  workflow  ( 13)  using  plasma  protein weights from the European ancestry (EA) subpopulation of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study ( n =  7213)  (ARIC)  (11),  where  plasma  protein  levels  had been  measured  using  the  aptamer-based  Somascan technology (V.4.1 platform). Protein weights and LD reference files were downloaded from http:// nilanjanchatterjeelab.org/pwas/. Prediction models were based on elastic net modeling (13). Multiple testing was accounted for by a Bonferroni adjustment for the number  of  unique  aptamers  modeled  across  traits ( P -value  &lt;  3.78  \u00d7  10 -5 =  0.05  /  1322  aptamers).  Overlap with significant GWAS  loci was determined using GWAS  variants  with P -value  &lt;5  \u00d7  10 -8 in  a  250  kb window around the PWAS gene.\n\n## Conditionally independent colocalization analysis\n\nA  colocalization  analysis  of  independent  signals  was performed for each significant association. Colocalization of TWAS findings was performed using publicly available cis -eQTL  summary  statistics  from  GTEx  v8 (EUR). For PWAS, we used cis -protein quantitative trait loci  (pQTL) summary statistics from EA participants of the  ARIC  study  (11 ).  As  LD  reference  data,  we  used  a subset  of  15,000  genomically  British  participants  from the  UK  Biobank  (application  number  20272);  genomic positions were converted to genome assembly GRCh38 (hg38) using the liftOver function from the rtracklayer R  package  (12).  Plasma  proteins  and  gene  expression summary  statistics were extracted for every gene significant  by  TWAS  or  PWAS  with  a  250  kb  flanking region.  First,  independent  association  signals  within these  regions  were  identified  based  on  approximate conditional  analyses  via  the  GCTA  COJO-Slct  algorithm (14),  with default parameters ( P -value &lt; 5 \u00d7 10 -8 and a collinearity of 0.9). For each conditionally independent SNP,  conditional  summary  statistics  were  computed by  conditioning  on  all  other  independent  SNPs  in  the gene region using the GCTA COJO-Cond algorithm with default parameters (collinearity of 0.9) (14). Subsequently, approximate Bayes factors-based colocalization analyses were conducted for all pairwise combinations of independent  eQTL/pQTL  associations  against  the independent thyroid function GWAS associations (15)  using  an  adapted  version  of  the  Giambartolomei colocalization  method  as  implemented  in  the  'coloc. fast' function (https://github.com/tobyjohnson/gtx), with default  parameters  and  prior  definitions  ( 16).  Positive colocalizations were reported if the posterior probability of a shared causal variant (PPH4/p12) was \u22650.8.\n\n## GO, KEGG, and tissue enrichment analyses\n\nEnrichment  testing  of  the  significant  genes  identified by  TWAS for TSH (297 genes) and for FT4 (113 genes) was performed in different resources using gene ontology  (GO)  terms  (17),  Kyoto  encyclopedia  of  genes and  genomes  (KEGG)  pathways  (18),  Human  protein atlas  (HPA)  tissues  (19),  and  GTEx  v8  tissues  (9),  with highly  expressed  genes  in  each  tissue  defined  as  the top 10% most highly expressed genes. For more details on  the  processing  of  the  tissue  resources,  see  ref.  20. For  all  enrichment  analyses,  we  used  hypergeometric tests implemented  in  the  R  package  clusterProfiler version 4.0.5 (21), where we selected the overlap of the 15,422  genes  encoding  for  transcripts  analyzed  during TWAS  with the genes available in the respective resource as background genes. When testing for enrichment  in  GO  terms  and  KEGG  pathways,  after overlapping with the available genes in the respective resource,  the  gene  set  originating  from  TSH  contained 186 and 95 genes, the gene set originating from FT4  contained  76  and  38  genes,  and  the  number  of background  genes  was  reduced  to  9629  and  4339, respectively. When performing tissue-specific enrichment analyses, the gene set  assigned  to  a  tissue was  filtered  for  genes  encoding  transcripts  analyzed during  TWAS.  All  results  were  filtered  for  terms  with at least two genes. P -values were corrected for multiple testing  using  the  Benjamini-Hochberg  procedure  (22) separately in each of the different resources.\n\n## Investigation of significant genes for associations with human traits and diseases through PheWAS\n\nWe  performed  queries  of  phenome-wide  association results  using  the  AstraZeneca  PheWAS  Portal.  These results  are  based  on  the  UK  Biobank  whole-exome sequencing  data  (469,809  UK  Biobank  exomes)  and contain associations for phenotypes derived from electronic health records, questionnaire data, and continuous  traits  released  by  UK  Biobank  (23).  We limited our queries to gene-level associations to directly  link  them  with  genes  detected  in  our  TWAS (385  genes)  and  PWAS  (28  genes).  Gene-level  analyses\n\nwere  based  on  collapsing  analyses,  which  aggregated rare, putatively deleterious, qualifying variants in each gene  with  given  criteria,  including  ten  dominant  and one recessive model, and testing them against a given phenotype. P -values for binary traits associations were determined by Fisher's exact two-sided test, and P -values for quantitative traits were determined by linear regression corrected for age, sex, and their interaction (age \u00d7 sex). We considered all available binary endpoints ( n =  10,088) and quantitative endpoints ( n =  1927). The total number  of  unique  phenotypes  was n =  14,956. Therefore, we defined the following significance thresholds  for  our  queries: P -value  &lt;  1.19  \u00d7  10 -7 (0.05 /  (28  genes  \u00d7  14,956  phenotypes))  for  genes  implicated by PWAS, and P -value &lt; 8.68 \u00d7 10 -9 (0.05 / (385 genes \u00d7 14,956 phenotypes)) for those implicated by TWAS. The queries  were  further  filtered  to  retain  binary  traits with more than 100 cases and controls and continuous traits  with  more  than  30  observations.  Additionally, the number of cases or controls with qualifying variants  in binary  phenotypes  and  the  number  of participants  with  qualifying  variants  in  quantitative phenotypes had to exceed 3.\n\n## Results\n\n## TWAS reveal expressed genes related to thyroid hormone metabolism\n\nWe performed an HPT axis tissue-specific TWAS based  on  gene  expression  models  derived  from  GTEx project v8 data (Supplementary Table 1, see section on supplementary materials given at the end of this article) (9,  13)  and  GWAS  summary  statistics  of  TSH  and  FT4 derived  from  up  to  271,040  individuals  of  European ancestry across 46 predominantly  population-based cohorts  from  the  ThyroidOmics  Consortium  (Fig.  1). Each transcript was predicted using tissue-specific gene  expression  information,  which  allowed  for  the identification  of  genetic  variants  associated  with  gene expression levels in the relevant tissue (i.e. hypothalamus, pituitary,  thyroid,  and  whole  blood).  Across  tissues, TWAS  yielded  297  and  113  transcripts  significantly associated  with  TSH  and  FT4,  respectively  (Fig.  2).  A total of 25  transcripts  were  significantly  associated with both hormones. Of these, 20 transcripts exhibited inverse  associations,  meaning  that  their  correlation with TSH was opposite to that with FT4 (Supplementary Fig. 1A and Supplementary  Table 2). The thyroid gland yielded the highest number of significant findings across all studied tissues, accounting  for  76.8%  of significant findings from TWAS of TSH and 64.6% from TWAS  of  FT4  (Fig.  2,  Supplementary  Fig.  1B,  C  and Supplementary Table 2).\n\nFrom  the  297  unique  transcripts  associated  with  TSH in one or more tissues, 24 were not encoded by a gene mapping into a significant GWAS  locus. Likewise, the  genes  encoding  14  out  of  the  113  significant  FT4associated  transcripts  did  not  map  into  a  significant\n\nGWAS  locus  (Methods,  Supplementary  Table  2).  Thus, TWAS enabled a gain in power to detect novel thyroid function-associated signals due to the reduced multiple testing  burden  of  gene-based  analysis  as  opposed  to variant-based analysis.\n\nTo assess whether the implicated transcripts represented a molecular link between genetic variation and  TSH  or  FT4  levels  or  independent  associations  in the  same  genetic  region,  we  performed  conditional genetic colocalization analyses. Strong  evidence  for colocalization, i.e. the posterior probability of a shared underlying  causal  variant  (PPH4  &gt;  0.8;  Methods),  was identified  between  thyroid  function  (GWAS)  and  gene expression for 158 (TSH) and 45 (FT4) transcripts in at least  one  of  the  studied  tissues  (Fig.  2,  Supplementary Figs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and Supplementary Table 3). These colocalization  results  are  consistent  with  regions  in which regulatory  variants  affect  both  gene  expression and thyroid function, thereby enabling the prioritization of potentially causal genes in the GWAS loci.\n\nReassuringly,  significant  findings  from  TWAS  of  TSH and FT4 contained multiple positive controls, i.e., transcripts encoded by genes known to have important roles in thyroid hormone  regulation.  For  example, TPO , encoding  the  TH-synthesizing  enzyme  thyroid peroxidase, and PDE8B , encoding phosphodiesterase 8B that catalyzes cAMP hydrolysis, a key second messenger in  TSH  signaling,  were  associated  with  both  TSH  and FT4. Testing for colocalization confirmed  a  shared genetic signal underlying both higher thyroid TPO and PDE8B expression  and  higher  levels  of  TSH,  as  well as  lower  levels  of  FT4  (Supplementary  Fig.  10).  In  line with  known  physiology,  the  colocalization  of  TSH  and FT4 GWAS signals with gene expression was present in thyroid  tissue,  but  not  in  the  hypothalamus,  pituitary, or whole blood. Along the same lines, the colocalization of  transcript  levels  of  the  TSH  receptor  encoding  for the gene TSHR with  TSH was present solely in thyroid tissue. This finding is in line with the fact that the TSH receptor is  predominantly expressed (9) and exerts its main function on the thyroid, as the TWAS of FT4 did not show a significant association (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 3).\n\n## Tissue-specific differential CAPZB expression links independent genetic variants to altered TSH levels\n\nWe  observed  a  significant  association  for CAPZB in both  thyroid-specific  ( P -value = 2.02  \u00d7  10 -215 )  as  well  as pituitary-specific  ( P -value = 1.57  \u00d7  10 -15 )  TWAS  of  TSH (Fig. 3). CAPZB expression models were unavailable for hypothalamus-  and  whole  blood-specific  TWAS  due  to the lack of significant heritability of the eQTL in these datasets. Nevertheless, colocalization analyses between GWAS and  gene  expression  could  be  conducted  in  all HPT  tissues. These  analyses  revealed  colocalization between  genetically higher TSH  levels and higher levels of CAPZB expression in both thyroid (PPH4 = 0.99)\n\nFigure 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWorkflow of integrated transcriptome and proteome-wide association studies of thyroid hormones TSH and FT4.\n\nand  hypothalamus  (PPH4 = 0.89).  A  moderately  strong colocalization  signal  (PPH4 = 0.75)  between  genetically higher TSH levels and higher levels of CAPZB expression in the pituitary was also identified. Interestingly, independent  TSH-associated  genetic  variants  seemed to differentially modulate CAPZB expression in a tissuedependent  manner,  as  shown  in  Fig.  3A:  whereas  a TSH-associated  genetic  signal  upstream  of CAPZB also underlies differential CAPZB expression in the thyroid, another  independent  genetic  signal  centered  on  the gene  body  underlies  differential CAPZB expression  in hypothalamus.\n\nTo further substantiate the regulatory potential of these  variants,  we  analyzed  functional  genomics  data from  thyroid  tissue  generated  by  the  ENCODE  Project Consortium and found that rs10799824, the implicated variant  upstream  of CAPZB , overlapped  with  open chromatin  (ATAC-seq).  Notably,  this  position  was  not accessible in other tissues from the same tissue donor (ENCDO451RUA)  ( Fig. 3B ), supporting tissue-specific regulatory  function.  These  findings  were  confirmed in  thyroid  tissue  of  a  different  donor  (ENCDO793LXB) (Methods,  Supplementary  Fig.  11A).  We  looked  into PheWeb using 1400 EHR-derived broad phenome-\n\nA\n\nB\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Figure 2\n\nResults of tissue-specific TWAS analyses.

To investigate potential relationships between the genes identified through our TWAS approach and rare damaging  variants  associated with thyroid disease, we  investigated  the  individual  and  aggregated  effects of  rare,  putatively  damaging  genetic  variants  across the exome using whole-exome sequencing and clinical  outcome  data  from  the  UK  Biobank  (23),  as implemented in the AZ Portal (Methods).  Our  analysis revealed  significant  associations  for  the  TSH  receptor gene with endocrine  and  metabolic diseases, such as hypothyroidism.  We  identified  other  associations described  in  Supplementary  Fig.  12,  Supplementary Tables 4 and 5.\n\n## Pathway enrichment for TWAS findings\n\nWe  next  performed  overrepresentation  analyses  for genes  encoding  for  significantly  associated  transcripts from  TWAS  using  GO  and  KEGG  databases  to  identify enriched pathways (Methods). For TSH, enriched biological processes (GO) and metabolic pathways (KEGG) were related to growth factors, cAMPmediated  signaling,  and  cAMP  biosynthetic  process. Additionally,  genes  encoding  for  associated  transcripts were  overrepresented  in  morphine  addiction,  relaxin signaling pathway, dopaminergic synapse, and chemical carcinogenesis, among others (Supplementary Fig. 13A and Supplementary Table 6). For FT4, enriched molecular functions  and  biological  processes  (GO),  as  well  as metabolic pathways (KEGG), were related to metabolic processes,  thyroid  hormone  generation,  metabolism, and signaling, as well as chemical carcinogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 13B and Supplementary Table 6).\n\nOverrepresentation analyses to identify tissues in which  the  target  transcripts  were  highly  expressed (Methods)  revealed  thyroid  tissue  for  both  TSH  and FT4  and  additionally  minor  salivary  gland  for  TSH (Supplementary Table 7). These results provide evidence  that  transcripts  implicated  by  TWAS  of  TSH and  FT4  are  indeed  involved  in  molecular  pathways that  are  relevant  to  thyroid  function  and  molecular metabolism, including TSH and FT4 regulation.\n\n## PWAS reveal plasma proteins related to thyroid function\n\nPWAS revealed significant associations between genetically predicted levels of 18 plasma proteins\n\n(Methods)  with  TSH  and  10  with  FT4.  Two  proteins, protein HEXIM1 and Sulfhydryl oxidase 2 (QSOX2), were associated with both hormones (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig.  14A  and  Supplementary  Table  8).  Evidence  for  a shared  causal  variant  from  colocalization  testing  was observed  for  five  TSH-  and  five  FT4-related  proteins (Supplementary Table 9). Although HEXIM1 and Sulfhydryl  oxidase  2  were  not  among  the  proteins  for which  colocalization  was  observed,  dedicated  testing for colocalization with gene expression showed  a shared genetic signal underlying FT4 levels and QSOX2 expression  in  both  thyroid  and  pituitary  (PPH4 = 0.969 and 0.968, respectively).\n\nFrom all significant plasma proteins detected by PWAS  of  thyroid  function,  the  genes  encoding  for  5 and  7  proteins  did  not  map  into  a  significant  GWAS locus for TSH  and  FT4,  respectively  (see  Methods, Supplementary  Table  8).  Details  about  the  function  of these novel TH-related candidates are summarized in  Supplementary  Table  10  (TSH)  and  Supplementary Table 11 (FT4).\n\nThere  were  11  significant  shared  findings  between PWAS  and  TWAS:  10  with  TWAS  of  TSH,  including HEXIM1,  and  one  with  TWAS  of  FT4  (Supplementary Fig.  14B  and  C),  providing  evidence  for  a  molecular chain  connecting  genetic  variation,  gene  expression, and protein levels with thyroid function. In particular, ANXA5  (annexin  A5)  showed  colocalization  between TSH-associated genetic variants with both their plasma protein  and  their  gene  expression  levels  in  HPT  axis tissues (Supplementary Table 12).\n\n## Annexin A5 is inversely associated with TSH levels\n\nWe observed a significant inverse association between plasma levels of  annexin  A5  and  TSH  (PWAS P -value =  1.18 \u00d7 10 -13 ), and an inverse association between TSH and ANXA5 expression in the hypothalamus (TWAS P -value = 6.40 \u00d7 10 -13 ), pituitary (TWAS P -value = 1.57  \u00d7  10 -15 ),  thyroid  (TWAS P -value = 4.27  \u00d7  10 -15 ), and  whole  blood  (TWAS P -value = 7.61  \u00d7  10 -12 ).  These findings  were  supported  by  colocalization  testing:  we observed  colocalization  between  TSH  GWAS  and  both annexin A5 plasma protein levels and gene expression in  all  studied  tissues,  with  lower  TSH  levels  related to  higher  protein  and  expression  levels.  In  line  with these  findings,  colocalization  between  plasma  protein and  gene  expression  levels  was  also  observed  with  a positive correlation (Fig. 5A).\n\nAnnexin A5 (Anxa A5, annexin V) is a member of the Ca 2+ -dependent phospholipid-binding protein family of annexins,  functioning  as  a  membrane  stabilizer. Once the membrane is bound, the function of annexins can vary: some members of the annexin family act in vesicle  trafficking  or  membrane  organization  ( 1,  25). Furthermore,  annexins,  including  annexin  A5,  have been  described  to  function  as  a  Ca 2+   channel  under certain conditions (25 ).  The  latter  finding  is  of  interest\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Figure 4\n\nResults of plasma PWAS analyses.

(B) Simplified conceptual model of annexin A5 exhibiting calcium channel activity in thyroid cells. Calcium is required for the H202 formation in the iodination process in the presence of NADPH, O2, dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2), and thyroid peroxidase (TPO). Subsequently, iodination of tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin (TG) takes place to form, after coupling, the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. * indicates a significant association found in TWAS.

Image created with BioRender .com.\n\nbecause  calcium  is  required  in  the  iodination  process and H2O2 production to form thyroid hormones (1). Additionally, a previous  study  showed  that  on continuous  daily  administration  of  calcium  channel blockers, a gradual fall in levels of T3 and T4 with a rise in TSH levels was observed in rabbits (26). Our results showed a positive although non-significant association between  FT4  and  FT3  levels  and ANXA5 expression in  the  thyroid  (TWAS P -value = 1.27  \u00d7  10 -02 and  TWAS P -value = 1.02  \u00d7  10 -01 , respectively),  and  a  significant inverse  relation  between  thyroid ANXA5 expression levels and  TSH,  consistent with  stimulation of TH production  in  presence  of  annexin  A5  and  displaying the negative feedback loop (Fig. 5b).\n\n## Connecting PWAS discoveries to rare thyroid-related variants using PheWAS\n\nWe  investigated whether  rare putatively damaging variants in the cognate genes of plasma proteins identified in PWAS  showed  significant associations across  a  broad  range  of  clinical  traits  and  diseases. We identified potential connections between rare variants in the genes encoding for plasma protein levels whose  predicted  levels  were  significantly  associated with  thyroid  traits  in  PWAS  (Supplementary  Fig.  15, Supplementary  Tables 13 and 14). Gene-phenotype associations were observed for PSCK1 (from FT4 analyses) with higher fat mass, weight, and phenotypes related to body mass index. Additionally, plasma levels of peptide YY (PYY), a gut hormone involved in appetite regulation and obesity, were also associated with PSCK1 (27). PSCK1 encodes the prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), a serine endoprotease responsible for processing precursor proteins as pro-neuropeptides and  prohormones  (28).  Moreover, IHH identified  by PWAS of FT4, was associated with respiratory function and  height-related  phenotypes.  It  encodes  a  signaling molecule  associated  with  the  regulation  of  skeletal growth  and  development,  phenotypes  influenced  by thyroid  hormones.  Lastly, HGFAC , which  encodes  a protease  that  activates  the  hepatocyte  growth  factor hormone  revealed  in  the  FT4  PWAS,  was  associated with  sex  hormone-binding  globulin  (SHBG).  Thyroid hormones  (T3  and  T4)  were  shown  to  act  indirectly to  increase  SHBG  production  in  the  liver  (29),  and could thus be part of the pathway from HGFAC expression to SHBG levels.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis  systematic  study  of  the  relation  of  genetically predicted tissue-specific levels of gene expression and  the  plasma  proteome  with  the  most  commonly quantified thyroid function-related hormones, TSH and FT4,  has  several  principal  findings:  first,  we  identified thyroid function-associated transcripts and  proteins that are missed by conventional GWAS even at sample sizes well over 250,000 individuals. Secondly, the analyses can help prioritize genes in GWAS  loci, including previously identified loci. Thirdly, conditional colocalization analyses increased confidence in candidates  that  share  a  genetic  basis  with  TH  and provided information about tissue-specific and tissue-shared  effects  on  gene  expression.  Functional annotation of candidate variants implicated a potentially causal,  TSH-related  regulatory  variant  driving CAPZB expression  in  the thyroid. Fourthly, shared  genetic causes of transcript, protein, and TSH levels support the role of annexin A5 in TH regulation.\n\nIn  comparison  to  a  prior  TWAS  study  focusing  on TSH (30),  our  expanded  study  involved  a  much  larger underlying GWAS  and incorporated PWAS  of the plasma  proteome,  revealing  a  comprehensive  set  of transcripts and proteins associated with both TSH and FT4 levels. Our results confirmed most of the previously reported associations but also revealed new ones, thus contributing  to  a  broader  understanding  of  thyroid function and expanding current knowledge.\n\nWe specifically selected those tissues in which genes that influence thyroid status and disease are predominantly expressed. For TWAS, we, therefore, focused on tissues within the HPT axis (2), namely hypothalamic, pituitary, and thyroid tissue, to examine thyroid hormone production,  as  well  as  whole  blood,  which  gives  a systemic  view  and  can  capture  genetic  influences  on thyroid  function  that  might  be  reflected  in  peripheral tissues. Most  of  the  significant  transcripts  for  both TSH  and  FT4  were  found  in  the  thyroid,  which  may partially be  attributable  to  a  higher  availability  of transcript  models  for  thyroid  TWAS  due  to  a  larger eQTL sample size for the thyroid compared to the hypothalamus  and  pituitary  in  the  GTEx  data. Additionally, it should  be  noted  that the observed number of transcripts associated in the thyroid with  TSH  and  FT4  cannot  be  directly  compared  to hypothalamus  and  pituitary  tissue,  as  the  latter  two have  a  more  complex  cell  type  composition  and  play a  role  in  regulating  different  hormones  (31).  Namely, the  hypothalamus  has  a  complex  and  heterogeneous population of neurons and glial cells that regulate also other endocrine axes, which can affect thyroid-related gene  expression  (32).  Similarly,  the  pituitary  gland  is composed  of  different  hormone-producing  cell  types, with  TSH-secreting  thyrotropes  making  up  less  than 10% of the cells in the gland (33).\n\nOur  results  also  underline  the  link  between  thyroid hormones  and  trace  elements  by  identifying  not  only DIO1  and  DIO2  but  also  the  Se  transport  receptor LRP8 and the selenoprotein-specific translational regulator SECISBP2L. These findings are not only consistent  with  the  well-studied  role  of  iodine  but also selenium in thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism (34, 35). This points toward potential tissue-specific links, motivating further studies in experimental models.\n\n## CAPZB - different SNPs related to different tissues\n\nSix  independent  variants  in  the CAPZB locus  were identified  in  the  TSH  GWAS.  Of  these,  the  intronic SNPs  rs12042004  and  rs10799824  upstream  of CAPZB colocalize  with  gene  expression  in  the  hypothalamus and thyroid, respectively. In agreement with a potential regulatory  role  in  the  thyroid,  rs10799824  maps  into an open chromatin peak in the thyroid but not in other studied  tissues. CAPZB encodes  the  \u03b2-subunit  of  the capping  protein  involved  in  TSH-induced  engulfment of  the  colloid  by  extension  of  microvilli  and  filopodia, representing a key step for thyroglobulin mobilization and subsequent proteolysis of thyroid hormones, including T3 and T4, in the thyroid gland (36). Given the location of rs10799824 in the thyroidspecific  open  chromatin  peak,  it  could  affect  thyroidspecific  gene  expression  of CAPZB ,  e.g.  via  differential transcription  factor  binding,  leading  to  differences  in the  amount  of  produced  thyroid  hormones.  In  turn, these  differences  could  cause  changes  in  the  observed variation of TSH via the negative feedback mechanism by T3 and T4.\n\n## Annexin A5 function in thyroid hormone production\n\nWe described a conceptual model regarding the function of annexin A5 in thyroid hormone production based  on  the  inverse  association  of  TSH  levels  and ANXA5 expression in thyroid and other HPT-axis tissues. A reverse association, namely an effect of TSH levels  on  annexin  A5  levels,  has  also  been  described: previous literature in pigs and rats have shown that  annexin  A5  levels  are  dependent  on  the  cAMP pathway  in  thyroid  cells,  and  that  concentrations  and localization of annexin proteins are under TSH control via this similar pathway, resulting in higher expression of  annexins  mediated  by  TSH-induced  cAMP  (37,  38). Conversely, TSH-stimulated thyroid cells from rats were inversely associated with ANXA5 expression (39 ).  Our  study  also  showed  novel  findings  regarding ANXA5 expression  in  the  other  HPT-axis  tissues  and whole blood, as well as a relation of annexin A5 plasma levels  with  lower  TSH  levels  and  higher  FT4  and  FT3 levels. Recent  studies supporting  these associations of ANXA5 expression  and  protein  levels  on  TSH  levels in  thyroid-related  tissues  are  sparse.  However,  given the  tight  relation  between  the  different  tissues  in  the HPT-axis, it can be expected that the associations with TSH  (and  FT4)  are  present  also  in  hypothalamic  and pituitary tissue, but that these are driven by the effect of ANXA5 in the thyroid. The PWAS findings are consistent with  the  high  abundance  of  annexin  A5  in  plasma as a reflection of the general function of annexins.\n\n## PheWAS supports the relation of PCSK1 to FT4 levels\n\nPheWAS of thyroid function-associated genes identified by  PWAS  revealed  associations  between  rare  genetic variants in PCSK1 and several anthropometric phenotypes, as well as association with PYY, a hormone related to appetite regulation. Rare mutations in PCSK1 are  known  to  result  in  a  loss  of  the  encoded enzyme's  autocatalytic  cleavage  ability,  leading  to  a variable pleiotropic syndrome that can include obesity (40), malabsorption diarrhea, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, growth hormone  deficiency, altered thyroid and  adrenal  function, or impaired  glucose regulation  (28, 41). With  regard  to  altered  thyroid function,  patients  with PCSK1 mutations  demonstrate (mild) central hypothyroidism with low FT4 levels and normal  to  low  TSH  levels.  This  is  in  agreement  with our  PWAS  findings  that  show  a  significant  association between PCSK1 -encoded plasma protein levels and  FT4  levels,  denoting  that  both  rare  and  common variants  in  the  gene  relate  to  functions  of  the  thyroid (Supplementary Tables 8 and 11).\n\n## Study strengths and limitations\n\nTWAS  and  PWAS  are  important  approaches  for  genebased prioritization and for delivering potential mechanistic information by revealing a possible correlation between gene expression or protein levels  and  a  trait.  As  exemplified  in  this  study  on  TSH and  FT4,  which  are  key  players  in  the  HPT-axis,  this approach  could  also  be  of  interest  to  other  axes  in endocrinology.  Similarly,  combining  TWAS  and  PWAS with  available  GWAS  data  could  be  used  to  identify the molecular underpinnings of endocrine circuits. For instance,  cortisol,  a  key  player  in  the  hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis (42), or GWAS data of luteinizing hormone  and follicle-stimulating hormone  as part of  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal  axis  (43),  can provide  valuable  insights  into  the  underlying  genetic architecture. However, it is important to keep in mind that co-regulation of gene expression or protein levels, as well as predicted expression correlations and shared variants between expression weight models, can induce bias  and therefore lead to false positive signals (7). To mitigate  this  potential  bias,  we  included  a  conditional colocalization analysis step and confirmed that several candidate transcripts and proteins revealed by the TWAS and PWAS have a shared causal variant with TSH and FT4 levels. Additionally, the ability of TWAS and PWAS approaches  to  establish  directionality  in  the  observed associations  is  limited.  While  these  approaches  enable the identification of potential  causal  links  between genetically regulated transcript and protein levels with TSH and FT4 levels, it  does  not  ascertain  which  is  the cause  and  which  is  the  consequence.  Experimental\n\nvalidations are needed to unravel the temporal sequence of these associations accurately.\n\nTaking  into  account  the  importance  of  T3  in  thyroid function,  larger  GWAS  on  this  hormone  are  needed  to also  include  T3  as  an  outcome  in  powerful  PWAS  and TWAS  analyses.  Lastly,  the  underlying  GWAS  solely incorporated information from individuals of European descent. We used matching transcript and protein level models  derived  from  persons  of  European  ancestry, but our findings may therefore not be generalizable to other ancestries.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn  summary,  we  performed  well-powered  association studies of genetically inferred, tissue-specific transcripts as well as plasma  protein  levels  with  the  thyroid function parameters TSH and FT4 levels. We identified novel thyroid function-associated genes, including those outside significant GWAS  loci. Tissue-specific colocalization  analysis  revealed  associations  between a  thyroid-specific  regulatory  variant,  rs10799824,  and CAPZB levels. Furthermore, we developed a conceptual framework consistent with the calcium channel activity  of  annexin  A5  in  thyroid  cells,  revealed  by inverse,  colocalization-supported  associations  between ANXA5 transcript  and  protein  levels  with  TSH  levels. Our  findings contribute to a better understanding of transcriptional regulation and protein levels relevant  to  thyroid  hormone  regulation.  Finally,  our approach  can  be  used  as  a  conceptual  blueprint  for other endocrine axes.\n\n## Supplementary materials\n\nThis is linked to the online version of the paper at https://doi.org/10.1530/ ETJ-24-0067.\n\n## Declaration of interest\n\nMM is on the Editorial Board of European Thyroid Journal .

They are regulated via the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and have a heritable component. Using genetic information, we applied tissue-specific transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and plasma proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) to elucidate gene products related to thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels.\n\nResults: TWAS identified 297 and 113 transcripts associated with TSH and FT4 levels, respectively (25 shared), including transcripts not identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these traits, demonstrating the increased power of this approach. Testing for genetic colocalization revealed a shared genetic basis of 158 transcripts with TSH and 45 transcripts with FT4, including independent, FT4-associated genetic signals within the CAPZB locus that were differentially associated with CAPZB expression in different tissues. PWAS identified 18 and ten proteins associated with TSH and FT4, respectively (HEXIM1 and QSOX2 with both). Among these, the cognate genes of five TSH- and 7 FT4-associated proteins mapped outside significant GWAS loci. Colocalization was observed for five plasma proteins each with TSH and FT4. There were ten TSH and one FT4-related gene(s) significant in both TWAS and PWAS. Of these, ANXA5 expression and plasma annexin A5 levels were inversely associated with TSH (PWAS: P = 1.18 \u00d7 10 -13 , TWAS: P = 7.61 \u00d7 10 -12 (whole blood), P = 6.40 \u00d7 10 -13 (hypothalamus), P = 1.57 \u00d7 10 -15 (pituitary), P = 4.27 \u00d7 10 -15 (thyroid)), supported by colocalizations.\n\nConclusion : Our analyses revealed new thyroid function-associated genes and prioritized candidates in known GWAS loci, contributing to a better understanding of transcriptional regulation and protein levels relevant to thyroid function.\n\nKeywords: TWAS; PWAS; HPT axis; thyroid; hypothalamus; pituitary; TSH; FT4; colocalization; metabolism\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Introduction\n\nThyroid hormones (TH) affect cellular metabolism and thereby have vital functions for growth and metabolic homeostasis  (1).  Thyroid  function  is  governed  by  the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid  (HPT)  axis,  where  the thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus stimulates  the  release  of  thyrotropin  (TSH)  from  the anterior  pituitary  gland,  which  in  turn  results  in  the production of the main hormones of the thyroid gland, thyroxine (T4) and  triiodothyronine (T3). Feedback loops  at different levels of the HPT  axis  maintain stable  thyroid  function.  Many  of  the  important  genes involved  in  the  HPT  axis  have  been  uncovered  by  the study  of  monogenic  disorders  of  thyroid  function  (2, 3). However,  important  new  knowledge  remains  to be  uncovered,  as  evidenced  by  recent  GWAS  of  TSH and free T4 (FT4) levels that identified both a new TH transport  protein  encoded  by SLC17A4, as  well  as  a previously unknown TH-metabolizing enzyme encoded by AADAT (4).  Hypothesis-generating screens based on genetic  information  are  therefore  suitable  to  identify and  prioritize  previously  unknown  players  in  thyroid function. A dedicated analysis of all known TH-regulating genes  (5)  moreover  revealed  that  variants  in  these genes detected by GWAS only accounted for a small percentage of variation in thyroid function measures.  This  suggests  the  presence  of  undiscovered TH-regulating genes within the HPT axis. A recent largescale GWAS  meta-analysis  investigated  the  genetics of  thyroid  function  parameters  such  as  TSH,  FT4,  and T3-related  traits  (6).  The  current  study  builds  on  this GWAS  and  investigates  the  two  most  commonly  used thyroid function markers, TSH and FT4, which were also the focus of previous GWAS on thyroid function (4).\n\nAs a genome-wide screen, GWAS needs to be stringently corrected  for  multiple  tests,  which  can  result  in  the missing of true association signals. Moreover, significant GWAS  loci  often  contain  several  genes,  complicating the  prioritization  of  the  causal  gene.  Lastly,  GWAS  do not  provide  information  about  tissue-specific  effects, although most common genetic variants implicated by GWAS are intronic or intergenic and may differentially affect gene expression. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)  can  address  these  three  challenges by  studying  the  effect  of  genetically  predicted,  tissuespecific differential gene expression on a disease or trait of  interest  (7,  8).  TWAS  utilizes  genomic  information associated with a specific phenotype (GWAS) and weight matrices, which are computed using SNP-mRNA associations  (expression  quantitative  trait  loci,  eQTL) data for the relevant tissues from GTEx v8 postmortem tissue from donors, acquired from rapid autopsy and  organ  procurement  organizations  (9,  10).  These matrices quantify the relationship between  genetic variants  and  gene  expression  levels.  TWAS  thereby only  needs  to  correct  for  the  number  of  evaluated transcripts  across  tissues  and  directly  implicate  the investigated  gene  product  as  a  molecular  trait  that links genetic variation to the disease or trait of interest. Proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) represent an analogous approach by studying the effect of genetically predicted protein levels, currently focused on the plasma proteome (11). In addition to the advantages of TWAS, PWAS can identify trait correlations with plasma protein levels  that  are  mediated  through  mechanisms  other than their differential gene expression, such as the trans effects of TSH and FT4 on the circulating proteome. This analysis can give us insights into the HPT axis, and to the best of our knowledge, such analyses have not been applied to investigate other endocrine axes.\n\nThe aims of this study were, therefore, to use TWAS and PWAS  to  uncover  additional  thyroid  function-related genes  previously  unreported  in  GWAS,  to  prioritize potentially  causal  genes  in  TSH-  and  FT4-associated GWAS  loci,  to  contrast  different  tissues  of  the  HPT axis, and  to  characterize  the  identified  associations through  a  series  of  downstream  analyses.  Here,  we unravel  new  thyroid  function-related  genes,  reflecting the increased power of TWAS and PWAS analyses, while also  providing  valuable  insights  into  shared  genetic signals  underlying  transcript  and  protein  levels  and thyroid function levels. The  resulting prioritization of genes in GWAS loci contributes to a better understanding  of  the  genetic  architecture  underlying thyroid  hormone  regulation  and  implicated  numerous previously unreported relationships, such as those for ANXA5 transcript and protein levels.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\n\nGWAS  of  inverse  normal  transformed  values  of  free T4  levels  ( n =  119,120 from  37  cohorts)  revealed  85 independent  significant  SNPs  ( Pvalue  &lt;  5  \u00d710 -8 ),  and of  inverse  normal  transformed  TSH  levels  ( n =  271,040 from 46 cohorts) resulted in 259 independent significant SNPs. All study participants were of European ancestry. Individual study files were filtered by  MAF  &gt;  0.005  and  by  imputation  quality  &gt;  0.4  at the  marker  level.  For  the  meta-analysis,  SNPs  with minor  allele  frequency  (MAF)  &lt;  0.01  or  SNPs  present in &lt;75% of the sample size were excluded. GWAS were performed using genome assembly hg37. Variant identifiers (rsIDs) were annotated and genomic positions were converted to genome assembly GRCh38 (hg38) using the liftOver function from the rtracklayer R package (12).\n\n## Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)\n\nTWAS were performed following the FUSION workflow (13) based on weights from GTEx v8 tissues (European ancestry) considered relevant for thyroid function\n\n(brain hypothalamus,  pituitary, thyroid, and  whole blood). Gene expression weights and linkage disequilibrium (LD) reference data for persons of European  (EUR)  ancestry  from  1000  Genomes  Project (1000G) were downloaded from http://gusevlab.org/ projects/fusion/. Prediction models were based on elastic net modeling (13). Multiple testing was accounted for  by  a  Bonferroni  adjustment  for  the  number  of unique  transcripts  modeled  across  traits  and  tissues ( P -value &lt; 1.74 \u00d7 10 -6 =  0.05/28,768 transcripts). FT3 TWAS was  performed  for  a  selected  candidate  gene, ANXA5 . Overlap  with  significant  GWAS  loci  was  determined using GWAS variants with P -value &lt; 5 \u00d7 10 -8 in a 250 kb window around the TWAS gene.\n\n## Proteome-wide association studies (PWAS)\n\nPWAS  were  performed  based  on  an  adapted  version of  the  FUSION  workflow  ( 13)  using  plasma  protein weights from the European ancestry (EA) subpopulation of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study ( n =  7213)  (ARIC)  (11),  where  plasma  protein  levels  had been  measured  using  the  aptamer-based  Somascan technology (V.4.1 platform). Protein weights and LD reference files were downloaded from http:// nilanjanchatterjeelab.org/pwas/. Prediction models were based on elastic net modeling (13). Multiple testing was accounted for by a Bonferroni adjustment for the number  of  unique  aptamers  modeled  across  traits ( P -value  &lt;  3.78  \u00d7  10 -5 =  0.05  /  1322  aptamers).  Overlap with significant GWAS  loci was determined using GWAS  variants  with P -value  &lt;5  \u00d7  10 -8 in  a  250  kb window around the PWAS gene.\n\n## Conditionally independent colocalization analysis\n\nA  colocalization  analysis  of  independent  signals  was performed for each significant association. Colocalization of TWAS findings was performed using publicly available cis -eQTL  summary  statistics  from  GTEx  v8 (EUR). For PWAS, we used cis -protein quantitative trait loci  (pQTL) summary statistics from EA participants of the  ARIC  study  (11 ).  As  LD  reference  data,  we  used  a subset  of  15,000  genomically  British  participants  from the  UK  Biobank  (application  number  20272);  genomic positions were converted to genome assembly GRCh38 (hg38) using the liftOver function from the rtracklayer R  package  (12).  Plasma  proteins  and  gene  expression summary  statistics were extracted for every gene significant  by  TWAS  or  PWAS  with  a  250  kb  flanking region.  First,  independent  association  signals  within these  regions  were  identified  based  on  approximate conditional  analyses  via  the  GCTA  COJO-Slct  algorithm (14),  with default parameters ( P -value &lt; 5 \u00d7 10 -8 and a collinearity of 0.9). For each conditionally independent SNP,  conditional  summary  statistics  were  computed by  conditioning  on  all  other  independent  SNPs  in  the gene region using the GCTA COJO-Cond algorithm with default parameters (collinearity of 0.9) (14). Subsequently, approximate Bayes factors-based colocalization analyses were conducted for all pairwise combinations of independent  eQTL/pQTL  associations  against  the independent thyroid function GWAS associations (15)  using  an  adapted  version  of  the  Giambartolomei colocalization  method  as  implemented  in  the  'coloc. fast' function (https://github.com/tobyjohnson/gtx), with default  parameters  and  prior  definitions  ( 16).  Positive colocalizations were reported if the posterior probability of a shared causal variant (PPH4/p12) was \u22650.8.\n\n## GO, KEGG, and tissue enrichment analyses\n\nEnrichment  testing  of  the  significant  genes  identified by  TWAS for TSH (297 genes) and for FT4 (113 genes) was performed in different resources using gene ontology  (GO)  terms  (17),  Kyoto  encyclopedia  of  genes and  genomes  (KEGG)  pathways  (18),  Human  protein atlas  (HPA)  tissues  (19),  and  GTEx  v8  tissues  (9),  with highly  expressed  genes  in  each  tissue  defined  as  the top 10% most highly expressed genes. For more details on  the  processing  of  the  tissue  resources,  see  ref.  20. For  all  enrichment  analyses,  we  used  hypergeometric tests implemented  in  the  R  package  clusterProfiler version 4.0.5 (21), where we selected the overlap of the 15,422  genes  encoding  for  transcripts  analyzed  during TWAS  with the genes available in the respective resource as background genes. When testing for enrichment  in  GO  terms  and  KEGG  pathways,  after overlapping with the available genes in the respective resource,  the  gene  set  originating  from  TSH  contained 186 and 95 genes, the gene set originating from FT4  contained  76  and  38  genes,  and  the  number  of background  genes  was  reduced  to  9629  and  4339, respectively. When performing tissue-specific enrichment analyses, the gene set  assigned  to  a  tissue was  filtered  for  genes  encoding  transcripts  analyzed during  TWAS.  All  results  were  filtered  for  terms  with at least two genes. P -values were corrected for multiple testing  using  the  Benjamini-Hochberg  procedure  (22) separately in each of the different resources.\n\n## Investigation of significant genes for associations with human traits and diseases through PheWAS\n\nWe  performed  queries  of  phenome-wide  association results  using  the  AstraZeneca  PheWAS  Portal.  These results  are  based  on  the  UK  Biobank  whole-exome sequencing  data  (469,809  UK  Biobank  exomes)  and contain associations for phenotypes derived from electronic health records, questionnaire data, and continuous  traits  released  by  UK  Biobank  (23).  We limited our queries to gene-level associations to directly  link  them  with  genes  detected  in  our  TWAS (385  genes)  and  PWAS  (28  genes).  Gene-level  analyses\n\nwere  based  on  collapsing  analyses,  which  aggregated rare, putatively deleterious, qualifying variants in each gene  with  given  criteria,  including  ten  dominant  and one recessive model, and testing them against a given phenotype. P -values for binary traits associations were determined by Fisher's exact two-sided test, and P -values for quantitative traits were determined by linear regression corrected for age, sex, and their interaction (age \u00d7 sex). We considered all available binary endpoints ( n =  10,088) and quantitative endpoints ( n =  1927). The total number  of  unique  phenotypes  was n =  14,956. Therefore, we defined the following significance thresholds  for  our  queries: P -value  &lt;  1.19  \u00d7  10 -7 (0.05 /  (28  genes  \u00d7  14,956  phenotypes))  for  genes  implicated by PWAS, and P -value &lt; 8.68 \u00d7 10 -9 (0.05 / (385 genes \u00d7 14,956 phenotypes)) for those implicated by TWAS. The queries  were  further  filtered  to  retain  binary  traits with more than 100 cases and controls and continuous traits  with  more  than  30  observations.  Additionally, the number of cases or controls with qualifying variants  in binary  phenotypes  and  the  number  of participants  with  qualifying  variants  in  quantitative phenotypes had to exceed 3.\n\n## Results\n\n## TWAS reveal expressed genes related to thyroid hormone metabolism\n\nWe performed an HPT axis tissue-specific TWAS based  on  gene  expression  models  derived  from  GTEx project v8 data (Supplementary Table 1, see section on supplementary materials given at the end of this article) (9,  13)  and  GWAS  summary  statistics  of  TSH  and  FT4 derived  from  up  to  271,040  individuals  of  European ancestry across 46 predominantly  population-based cohorts  from  the  ThyroidOmics  Consortium  (Fig.  1). Each transcript was predicted using tissue-specific gene  expression  information,  which  allowed  for  the identification  of  genetic  variants  associated  with  gene expression levels in the relevant tissue (i.e. hypothalamus, pituitary,  thyroid,  and  whole  blood).  Across  tissues, TWAS  yielded  297  and  113  transcripts  significantly associated  with  TSH  and  FT4,  respectively  (Fig.  2).  A total of 25  transcripts  were  significantly  associated with both hormones. Of these, 20 transcripts exhibited inverse  associations,  meaning  that  their  correlation with TSH was opposite to that with FT4 (Supplementary Fig. 1A and Supplementary  Table 2). The thyroid gland yielded the highest number of significant findings across all studied tissues, accounting  for  76.8%  of significant findings from TWAS of TSH and 64.6% from TWAS  of  FT4  (Fig.  2,  Supplementary  Fig.  1B,  C  and Supplementary Table 2).\n\nFrom  the  297  unique  transcripts  associated  with  TSH in one or more tissues, 24 were not encoded by a gene mapping into a significant GWAS  locus. Likewise, the  genes  encoding  14  out  of  the  113  significant  FT4associated  transcripts  did  not  map  into  a  significant\n\nGWAS  locus  (Methods,  Supplementary  Table  2).  Thus, TWAS enabled a gain in power to detect novel thyroid function-associated signals due to the reduced multiple testing  burden  of  gene-based  analysis  as  opposed  to variant-based analysis.\n\nTo assess whether the implicated transcripts represented a molecular link between genetic variation and  TSH  or  FT4  levels  or  independent  associations  in the  same  genetic  region,  we  performed  conditional genetic colocalization analyses. Strong  evidence  for colocalization, i.e. the posterior probability of a shared underlying  causal  variant  (PPH4  &gt;  0.8;  Methods),  was identified  between  thyroid  function  (GWAS)  and  gene expression for 158 (TSH) and 45 (FT4) transcripts in at least  one  of  the  studied  tissues  (Fig.  2,  Supplementary Figs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and Supplementary Table 3). These colocalization  results  are  consistent  with  regions  in which regulatory  variants  affect  both  gene  expression and thyroid function, thereby enabling the prioritization of potentially causal genes in the GWAS loci.\n\nReassuringly,  significant  findings  from  TWAS  of  TSH and FT4 contained multiple positive controls, i.e., transcripts encoded by genes known to have important roles in thyroid hormone  regulation.  For  example, TPO , encoding  the  TH-synthesizing  enzyme  thyroid peroxidase, and PDE8B , encoding phosphodiesterase 8B that catalyzes cAMP hydrolysis, a key second messenger in  TSH  signaling,  were  associated  with  both  TSH  and FT4. Testing for colocalization confirmed  a  shared genetic signal underlying both higher thyroid TPO and PDE8B expression  and  higher  levels  of  TSH,  as  well as  lower  levels  of  FT4  (Supplementary  Fig.  10).  In  line with  known  physiology,  the  colocalization  of  TSH  and FT4 GWAS signals with gene expression was present in thyroid  tissue,  but  not  in  the  hypothalamus,  pituitary, or whole blood. Along the same lines, the colocalization of  transcript  levels  of  the  TSH  receptor  encoding  for the gene TSHR with  TSH was present solely in thyroid tissue. This finding is in line with the fact that the TSH receptor is  predominantly expressed (9) and exerts its main function on the thyroid, as the TWAS of FT4 did not show a significant association (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 3).\n\n## Tissue-specific differential CAPZB expression links independent genetic variants to altered TSH levels\n\nWe  observed  a  significant  association  for CAPZB in both  thyroid-specific  ( P -value = 2.02  \u00d7  10 -215 )  as  well  as pituitary-specific  ( P -value = 1.57  \u00d7  10 -15 )  TWAS  of  TSH (Fig. 3). CAPZB expression models were unavailable for hypothalamus-  and  whole  blood-specific  TWAS  due  to the lack of significant heritability of the eQTL in these datasets. Nevertheless, colocalization analyses between GWAS and  gene  expression  could  be  conducted  in  all HPT  tissues. These  analyses  revealed  colocalization between  genetically higher TSH  levels and higher levels of CAPZB expression in both thyroid (PPH4 = 0.99)\n\nFigure 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWorkflow of integrated transcriptome and proteome-wide association studies of thyroid hormones TSH and FT4.\n\nand  hypothalamus  (PPH4 = 0.89).  A  moderately  strong colocalization  signal  (PPH4 = 0.75)  between  genetically higher TSH levels and higher levels of CAPZB expression in the pituitary was also identified. Interestingly, independent  TSH-associated  genetic  variants  seemed to differentially modulate CAPZB expression in a tissuedependent  manner,  as  shown  in  Fig.  3A:  whereas  a TSH-associated  genetic  signal  upstream  of CAPZB also underlies differential CAPZB expression in the thyroid, another  independent  genetic  signal  centered  on  the gene  body  underlies  differential CAPZB expression  in hypothalamus.\n\nTo further substantiate the regulatory potential of these  variants,  we  analyzed  functional  genomics  data from  thyroid  tissue  generated  by  the  ENCODE  Project Consortium and found that rs10799824, the implicated variant  upstream  of CAPZB , overlapped  with  open chromatin  (ATAC-seq).  Notably,  this  position  was  not accessible in other tissues from the same tissue donor (ENCDO451RUA)  ( Fig. 3B ), supporting tissue-specific regulatory  function.  These  findings  were  confirmed in  thyroid  tissue  of  a  different  donor  (ENCDO793LXB) (Methods,  Supplementary  Fig.  11A).  We  looked  into PheWeb using 1400 EHR-derived broad phenome-\n\nA\n\nB\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Figure 2\n\nResults of tissue-specific TWAS analyses.

To investigate potential relationships between the genes identified through our TWAS approach and rare damaging  variants  associated with thyroid disease, we  investigated  the  individual  and  aggregated  effects of  rare,  putatively  damaging  genetic  variants  across the exome using whole-exome sequencing and clinical  outcome  data  from  the  UK  Biobank  (23),  as implemented in the AZ Portal (Methods).  Our  analysis revealed  significant  associations  for  the  TSH  receptor gene with endocrine  and  metabolic diseases, such as hypothyroidism.  We  identified  other  associations described  in  Supplementary  Fig.  12,  Supplementary Tables 4 and 5.\n\n## Pathway enrichment for TWAS findings\n\nWe  next  performed  overrepresentation  analyses  for genes  encoding  for  significantly  associated  transcripts from  TWAS  using  GO  and  KEGG  databases  to  identify enriched pathways (Methods). For TSH, enriched biological processes (GO) and metabolic pathways (KEGG) were related to growth factors, cAMPmediated  signaling,  and  cAMP  biosynthetic  process. Additionally,  genes  encoding  for  associated  transcripts were  overrepresented  in  morphine  addiction,  relaxin signaling pathway, dopaminergic synapse, and chemical carcinogenesis, among others (Supplementary Fig. 13A and Supplementary Table 6). For FT4, enriched molecular functions  and  biological  processes  (GO),  as  well  as metabolic pathways (KEGG), were related to metabolic processes,  thyroid  hormone  generation,  metabolism, and signaling, as well as chemical carcinogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 13B and Supplementary Table 6).\n\nOverrepresentation analyses to identify tissues in which  the  target  transcripts  were  highly  expressed (Methods)  revealed  thyroid  tissue  for  both  TSH  and FT4  and  additionally  minor  salivary  gland  for  TSH (Supplementary Table 7). These results provide evidence  that  transcripts  implicated  by  TWAS  of  TSH and  FT4  are  indeed  involved  in  molecular  pathways that  are  relevant  to  thyroid  function  and  molecular metabolism, including TSH and FT4 regulation.\n\n## PWAS reveal plasma proteins related to thyroid function\n\nPWAS revealed significant associations between genetically predicted levels of 18 plasma proteins\n\n(Methods)  with  TSH  and  10  with  FT4.  Two  proteins, protein HEXIM1 and Sulfhydryl oxidase 2 (QSOX2), were associated with both hormones (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig.  14A  and  Supplementary  Table  8).  Evidence  for  a shared  causal  variant  from  colocalization  testing  was observed  for  five  TSH-  and  five  FT4-related  proteins (Supplementary Table 9). Although HEXIM1 and Sulfhydryl  oxidase  2  were  not  among  the  proteins  for which  colocalization  was  observed,  dedicated  testing for colocalization with gene expression showed  a shared genetic signal underlying FT4 levels and QSOX2 expression  in  both  thyroid  and  pituitary  (PPH4 = 0.969 and 0.968, respectively).\n\nFrom all significant plasma proteins detected by PWAS  of  thyroid  function,  the  genes  encoding  for  5 and  7  proteins  did  not  map  into  a  significant  GWAS locus for TSH  and  FT4,  respectively  (see  Methods, Supplementary  Table  8).  Details  about  the  function  of these novel TH-related candidates are summarized in  Supplementary  Table  10  (TSH)  and  Supplementary Table 11 (FT4).\n\nThere  were  11  significant  shared  findings  between PWAS  and  TWAS:  10  with  TWAS  of  TSH,  including HEXIM1,  and  one  with  TWAS  of  FT4  (Supplementary Fig.  14B  and  C),  providing  evidence  for  a  molecular chain  connecting  genetic  variation,  gene  expression, and protein levels with thyroid function. In particular, ANXA5  (annexin  A5)  showed  colocalization  between TSH-associated genetic variants with both their plasma protein  and  their  gene  expression  levels  in  HPT  axis tissues (Supplementary Table 12).\n\n## Annexin A5 is inversely associated with TSH levels\n\nWe observed a significant inverse association between plasma levels of  annexin  A5  and  TSH  (PWAS P -value =  1.18 \u00d7 10 -13 ), and an inverse association between TSH and ANXA5 expression in the hypothalamus (TWAS P -value = 6.40 \u00d7 10 -13 ), pituitary (TWAS P -value = 1.57  \u00d7  10 -15 ),  thyroid  (TWAS P -value = 4.27  \u00d7  10 -15 ), and  whole  blood  (TWAS P -value = 7.61  \u00d7  10 -12 ).  These findings  were  supported  by  colocalization  testing:  we observed  colocalization  between  TSH  GWAS  and  both annexin A5 plasma protein levels and gene expression in  all  studied  tissues,  with  lower  TSH  levels  related to  higher  protein  and  expression  levels.  In  line  with these  findings,  colocalization  between  plasma  protein and  gene  expression  levels  was  also  observed  with  a positive correlation (Fig. 5A).\n\nAnnexin A5 (Anxa A5, annexin V) is a member of the Ca 2+ -dependent phospholipid-binding protein family of annexins,  functioning  as  a  membrane  stabilizer. Once the membrane is bound, the function of annexins can vary: some members of the annexin family act in vesicle  trafficking  or  membrane  organization  ( 1,  25). Furthermore,  annexins,  including  annexin  A5,  have been  described  to  function  as  a  Ca 2+   channel  under certain conditions (25 ).  The  latter  finding  is  of  interest\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Figure 4\n\nResults of plasma PWAS analyses.

Genes, exons, and the direction of transcription from the University of California at Santa Cruz genome browser are depicted. Plots were generated using Locus Zoom ( 44 ). (B) Simplified conceptual model of annexin A5 exhibiting calcium channel activity in thyroid cells. Calcium is required for the H202 formation in the iodination process in the presence of NADPH, O2, dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2), and thyroid peroxidase (TPO). Subsequently, iodination of tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin (TG) takes place to form, after coupling, the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. * indicates a significant association found in TWAS.

Image created with BioRender .com.\n\nbecause  calcium  is  required  in  the  iodination  process and H2O2 production to form thyroid hormones (1). Additionally, a previous  study  showed  that  on continuous  daily  administration  of  calcium  channel blockers, a gradual fall in levels of T3 and T4 with a rise in TSH levels was observed in rabbits (26). Our results showed a positive although non-significant association between  FT4  and  FT3  levels  and ANXA5 expression in  the  thyroid  (TWAS P -value = 1.27  \u00d7  10 -02 and  TWAS P -value = 1.02  \u00d7  10 -01 , respectively),  and  a  significant inverse  relation  between  thyroid ANXA5 expression levels and  TSH,  consistent with  stimulation of TH production  in  presence  of  annexin  A5  and  displaying the negative feedback loop (Fig. 5b).\n\n## Connecting PWAS discoveries to rare thyroid-related variants using PheWAS\n\nWe  investigated whether  rare putatively damaging variants in the cognate genes of plasma proteins identified in PWAS  showed  significant associations across  a  broad  range  of  clinical  traits  and  diseases. We identified potential connections between rare variants in the genes encoding for plasma protein levels whose  predicted  levels  were  significantly  associated with  thyroid  traits  in  PWAS  (Supplementary  Fig.  15, Supplementary  Tables 13 and 14). Gene-phenotype associations were observed for PSCK1 (from FT4 analyses) with higher fat mass, weight, and phenotypes related to body mass index. Additionally, plasma levels of peptide YY (PYY), a gut hormone involved in appetite regulation and obesity, were also associated with PSCK1 (27). PSCK1 encodes the prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), a serine endoprotease responsible for processing precursor proteins as pro-neuropeptides and  prohormones  (28).  Moreover, IHH identified  by PWAS of FT4, was associated with respiratory function and  height-related  phenotypes.  It  encodes  a  signaling molecule  associated  with  the  regulation  of  skeletal growth  and  development,  phenotypes  influenced  by thyroid  hormones.  Lastly, HGFAC , which  encodes  a protease  that  activates  the  hepatocyte  growth  factor hormone  revealed  in  the  FT4  PWAS,  was  associated with  sex  hormone-binding  globulin  (SHBG).  Thyroid hormones  (T3  and  T4)  were  shown  to  act  indirectly to  increase  SHBG  production  in  the  liver  (29),  and could thus be part of the pathway from HGFAC expression to SHBG levels.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis  systematic  study  of  the  relation  of  genetically predicted tissue-specific levels of gene expression and  the  plasma  proteome  with  the  most  commonly quantified thyroid function-related hormones, TSH and FT4,  has  several  principal  findings:  first,  we  identified thyroid function-associated transcripts and  proteins that are missed by conventional GWAS even at sample sizes well over 250,000 individuals. Secondly, the analyses can help prioritize genes in GWAS  loci, including previously identified loci. Thirdly, conditional colocalization analyses increased confidence in candidates  that  share  a  genetic  basis  with  TH  and provided information about tissue-specific and tissue-shared  effects  on  gene  expression.  Functional annotation of candidate variants implicated a potentially causal,  TSH-related  regulatory  variant  driving CAPZB expression  in  the thyroid. Fourthly, shared  genetic causes of transcript, protein, and TSH levels support the role of annexin A5 in TH regulation.\n\nIn  comparison  to  a  prior  TWAS  study  focusing  on TSH (30),  our  expanded  study  involved  a  much  larger underlying GWAS  and incorporated PWAS  of the plasma  proteome,  revealing  a  comprehensive  set  of transcripts and proteins associated with both TSH and FT4 levels. Our results confirmed most of the previously reported associations but also revealed new ones, thus contributing  to  a  broader  understanding  of  thyroid function and expanding current knowledge.\n\nWe specifically selected those tissues in which genes that influence thyroid status and disease are predominantly expressed. For TWAS, we, therefore, focused on tissues within the HPT axis (2), namely hypothalamic, pituitary, and thyroid tissue, to examine thyroid hormone production,  as  well  as  whole  blood,  which  gives  a systemic  view  and  can  capture  genetic  influences  on thyroid  function  that  might  be  reflected  in  peripheral tissues. Most  of  the  significant  transcripts  for  both TSH  and  FT4  were  found  in  the  thyroid,  which  may partially be  attributable  to  a  higher  availability  of transcript  models  for  thyroid  TWAS  due  to  a  larger eQTL sample size for the thyroid compared to the hypothalamus  and  pituitary  in  the  GTEx  data. Additionally, it should  be  noted  that the observed number of transcripts associated in the thyroid with  TSH  and  FT4  cannot  be  directly  compared  to hypothalamus  and  pituitary  tissue,  as  the  latter  two have  a  more  complex  cell  type  composition  and  play a  role  in  regulating  different  hormones  (31).  Namely, the  hypothalamus  has  a  complex  and  heterogeneous population of neurons and glial cells that regulate also other endocrine axes, which can affect thyroid-related gene  expression  (32).  Similarly,  the  pituitary  gland  is composed  of  different  hormone-producing  cell  types, with  TSH-secreting  thyrotropes  making  up  less  than 10% of the cells in the gland (33).\n\nOur  results  also  underline  the  link  between  thyroid hormones  and  trace  elements  by  identifying  not  only DIO1  and  DIO2  but  also  the  Se  transport  receptor LRP8 and the selenoprotein-specific translational regulator SECISBP2L. These findings are not only consistent  with  the  well-studied  role  of  iodine  but also selenium in thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism (34, 35). This points toward potential tissue-specific links, motivating further studies in experimental models.\n\n## CAPZB - different SNPs related to different tissues\n\nSix  independent  variants  in  the CAPZB locus  were identified  in  the  TSH  GWAS.  Of  these,  the  intronic SNPs  rs12042004  and  rs10799824  upstream  of CAPZB colocalize  with  gene  expression  in  the  hypothalamus and thyroid, respectively. In agreement with a potential regulatory  role  in  the  thyroid,  rs10799824  maps  into an open chromatin peak in the thyroid but not in other studied  tissues. CAPZB encodes  the  \u03b2-subunit  of  the capping  protein  involved  in  TSH-induced  engulfment of  the  colloid  by  extension  of  microvilli  and  filopodia, representing a key step for thyroglobulin mobilization and subsequent proteolysis of thyroid hormones, including T3 and T4, in the thyroid gland (36). Given the location of rs10799824 in the thyroidspecific  open  chromatin  peak,  it  could  affect  thyroidspecific  gene  expression  of CAPZB ,  e.g.  via  differential transcription  factor  binding,  leading  to  differences  in the  amount  of  produced  thyroid  hormones.  In  turn, these  differences  could  cause  changes  in  the  observed variation of TSH via the negative feedback mechanism by T3 and T4.\n\n## Annexin A5 function in thyroid hormone production\n\nWe described a conceptual model regarding the function of annexin A5 in thyroid hormone production based  on  the  inverse  association  of  TSH  levels  and ANXA5 expression in thyroid and other HPT-axis tissues. A reverse association, namely an effect of TSH levels  on  annexin  A5  levels,  has  also  been  described: previous literature in pigs and rats have shown that  annexin  A5  levels  are  dependent  on  the  cAMP pathway  in  thyroid  cells,  and  that  concentrations  and localization of annexin proteins are under TSH control via this similar pathway, resulting in higher expression of  annexins  mediated  by  TSH-induced  cAMP  (37,  38). Conversely, TSH-stimulated thyroid cells from rats were inversely associated with ANXA5 expression (39 ).  Our  study  also  showed  novel  findings  regarding ANXA5 expression  in  the  other  HPT-axis  tissues  and whole blood, as well as a relation of annexin A5 plasma levels  with  lower  TSH  levels  and  higher  FT4  and  FT3 levels. Recent  studies supporting  these associations of ANXA5 expression  and  protein  levels  on  TSH  levels in  thyroid-related  tissues  are  sparse.  However,  given the  tight  relation  between  the  different  tissues  in  the HPT-axis, it can be expected that the associations with TSH  (and  FT4)  are  present  also  in  hypothalamic  and pituitary tissue, but that these are driven by the effect of ANXA5 in the thyroid. The PWAS findings are consistent with  the  high  abundance  of  annexin  A5  in  plasma as a reflection of the general function of annexins.\n\n## PheWAS supports the relation of PCSK1 to FT4 levels\n\nPheWAS of thyroid function-associated genes identified by  PWAS  revealed  associations  between  rare  genetic variants in PCSK1 and several anthropometric phenotypes, as well as association with PYY, a hormone related to appetite regulation. Rare mutations in PCSK1 are  known  to  result  in  a  loss  of  the  encoded enzyme's  autocatalytic  cleavage  ability,  leading  to  a variable pleiotropic syndrome that can include obesity (40), malabsorption diarrhea, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, growth hormone  deficiency, altered thyroid and  adrenal  function, or impaired  glucose regulation  (28, 41). With  regard  to  altered  thyroid function,  patients  with PCSK1 mutations  demonstrate (mild) central hypothyroidism with low FT4 levels and normal  to  low  TSH  levels.  This  is  in  agreement  with our  PWAS  findings  that  show  a  significant  association between PCSK1 -encoded plasma protein levels and  FT4  levels,  denoting  that  both  rare  and  common variants  in  the  gene  relate  to  functions  of  the  thyroid (Supplementary Tables 8 and 11).\n\n## Study strengths and limitations\n\nTWAS  and  PWAS  are  important  approaches  for  genebased prioritization and for delivering potential mechanistic information by revealing a possible correlation between gene expression or protein levels  and  a  trait.  As  exemplified  in  this  study  on  TSH and  FT4,  which  are  key  players  in  the  HPT-axis,  this approach  could  also  be  of  interest  to  other  axes  in endocrinology.  Similarly,  combining  TWAS  and  PWAS with  available  GWAS  data  could  be  used  to  identify the molecular underpinnings of endocrine circuits. For instance,  cortisol,  a  key  player  in  the  hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis (42), or GWAS data of luteinizing hormone  and follicle-stimulating hormone  as part of  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal  axis  (43),  can provide  valuable  insights  into  the  underlying  genetic architecture. However, it is important to keep in mind that co-regulation of gene expression or protein levels, as well as predicted expression correlations and shared variants between expression weight models, can induce bias  and therefore lead to false positive signals (7). To mitigate  this  potential  bias,  we  included  a  conditional colocalization analysis step and confirmed that several candidate transcripts and proteins revealed by the TWAS and PWAS have a shared causal variant with TSH and FT4 levels. Additionally, the ability of TWAS and PWAS approaches  to  establish  directionality  in  the  observed associations  is  limited.  While  these  approaches  enable the identification of potential  causal  links  between genetically regulated transcript and protein levels with TSH and FT4 levels, it  does  not  ascertain  which  is  the cause  and  which  is  the  consequence.  Experimental\n\nvalidations are needed to unravel the temporal sequence of these associations accurately.\n\nTaking  into  account  the  importance  of  T3  in  thyroid function,  larger  GWAS  on  this  hormone  are  needed  to also  include  T3  as  an  outcome  in  powerful  PWAS  and TWAS  analyses.  Lastly,  the  underlying  GWAS  solely incorporated information from individuals of European descent. We used matching transcript and protein level models  derived  from  persons  of  European  ancestry, but our findings may therefore not be generalizable to other ancestries.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn  summary,  we  performed  well-powered  association studies of genetically inferred, tissue-specific transcripts as well as plasma  protein  levels  with  the  thyroid function parameters TSH and FT4 levels. We identified novel thyroid function-associated genes, including those outside significant GWAS  loci. Tissue-specific colocalization  analysis  revealed  associations  between a  thyroid-specific  regulatory  variant,  rs10799824,  and CAPZB levels. Furthermore, we developed a conceptual framework consistent with the calcium channel activity  of  annexin  A5  in  thyroid  cells,  revealed  by inverse,  colocalization-supported  associations  between ANXA5 transcript  and  protein  levels  with  TSH  levels. Our  findings contribute to a better understanding of transcriptional regulation and protein levels relevant  to  thyroid  hormone  regulation.  Finally,  our approach  can  be  used  as  a  conceptual  blueprint  for other endocrine axes.\n\n## Supplementary materials\n\nThis is linked to the online version of the paper at https://doi.org/10.1530/ ETJ-24-0067.\n\n## Declaration of interest\n\nMM is on the Editorial Board of European Thyroid Journal .

They are regulated via the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and have a heritable component. Using genetic information, we applied tissue-specific transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and plasma proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) to elucidate gene products related to thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels.\n\nResults: TWAS identified 297 and 113 transcripts associated with TSH and FT4 levels, respectively (25 shared), including transcripts not identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these traits, demonstrating the increased power of this approach. Testing for genetic colocalization revealed a shared genetic basis of 158 transcripts with TSH and 45 transcripts with FT4, including independent, FT4-associated genetic signals within the CAPZB locus that were differentially associated with CAPZB expression in different tissues. PWAS identified 18 and ten proteins associated with TSH and FT4, respectively (HEXIM1 and QSOX2 with both). Among these, the cognate genes of five TSH- and 7 FT4-associated proteins mapped outside significant GWAS loci. Colocalization was observed for five plasma proteins each with TSH and FT4. There were ten TSH and one FT4-related gene(s) significant in both TWAS and PWAS. Of these, ANXA5 expression and plasma annexin A5 levels were inversely associated with TSH (PWAS: P = 1.18 \u00d7 10 -13 , TWAS: P = 7.61 \u00d7 10 -12 (whole blood), P = 6.40 \u00d7 10 -13 (hypothalamus), P = 1.57 \u00d7 10 -15 (pituitary), P = 4.27 \u00d7 10 -15 (thyroid)), supported by colocalizations.\n\nConclusion : Our analyses revealed new thyroid function-associated genes and prioritized candidates in known GWAS loci, contributing to a better understanding of transcriptional regulation and protein levels relevant to thyroid function.\n\nKeywords: TWAS; PWAS; HPT axis; thyroid; hypothalamus; pituitary; TSH; FT4; colocalization; metabolism\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Introduction\n\nThyroid hormones (TH) affect cellular metabolism and thereby have vital functions for growth and metabolic homeostasis  (1).  Thyroid  function  is  governed  by  the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid  (HPT)  axis,  where  the thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus stimulates  the  release  of  thyrotropin  (TSH)  from  the anterior  pituitary  gland,  which  in  turn  results  in  the production of the main hormones of the thyroid gland, thyroxine (T4) and  triiodothyronine (T3). Feedback loops  at different levels of the HPT  axis  maintain stable  thyroid  function.  Many  of  the  important  genes involved  in  the  HPT  axis  have  been  uncovered  by  the study  of  monogenic  disorders  of  thyroid  function  (2, 3). However,  important  new  knowledge  remains  to be  uncovered,  as  evidenced  by  recent  GWAS  of  TSH and free T4 (FT4) levels that identified both a new TH transport  protein  encoded  by SLC17A4, as  well  as  a previously unknown TH-metabolizing enzyme encoded by AADAT (4).  Hypothesis-generating screens based on genetic  information  are  therefore  suitable  to  identify and  prioritize  previously  unknown  players  in  thyroid function. A dedicated analysis of all known TH-regulating genes  (5)  moreover  revealed  that  variants  in  these genes detected by GWAS only accounted for a small percentage of variation in thyroid function measures.  This  suggests  the  presence  of  undiscovered TH-regulating genes within the HPT axis. A recent largescale GWAS  meta-analysis  investigated  the  genetics of  thyroid  function  parameters  such  as  TSH,  FT4,  and T3-related  traits  (6).  The  current  study  builds  on  this GWAS  and  investigates  the  two  most  commonly  used thyroid function markers, TSH and FT4, which were also the focus of previous GWAS on thyroid function (4).\n\nAs a genome-wide screen, GWAS needs to be stringently corrected  for  multiple  tests,  which  can  result  in  the missing of true association signals. Moreover, significant GWAS  loci  often  contain  several  genes,  complicating the  prioritization  of  the  causal  gene.  Lastly,  GWAS  do not  provide  information  about  tissue-specific  effects, although most common genetic variants implicated by GWAS are intronic or intergenic and may differentially affect gene expression. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)  can  address  these  three  challenges by  studying  the  effect  of  genetically  predicted,  tissuespecific differential gene expression on a disease or trait of  interest  (7,  8).  TWAS  utilizes  genomic  information associated with a specific phenotype (GWAS) and weight matrices, which are computed using SNP-mRNA associations  (expression  quantitative  trait  loci,  eQTL) data for the relevant tissues from GTEx v8 postmortem tissue from donors, acquired from rapid autopsy and  organ  procurement  organizations  (9,  10).  These matrices quantify the relationship between  genetic variants  and  gene  expression  levels.  TWAS  thereby only  needs  to  correct  for  the  number  of  evaluated transcripts  across  tissues  and  directly  implicate  the investigated  gene  product  as  a  molecular  trait  that links genetic variation to the disease or trait of interest. Proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) represent an analogous approach by studying the effect of genetically predicted protein levels, currently focused on the plasma proteome (11). In addition to the advantages of TWAS, PWAS can identify trait correlations with plasma protein levels  that  are  mediated  through  mechanisms  other than their differential gene expression, such as the trans effects of TSH and FT4 on the circulating proteome. This analysis can give us insights into the HPT axis, and to the best of our knowledge, such analyses have not been applied to investigate other endocrine axes.\n\nThe aims of this study were, therefore, to use TWAS and PWAS  to  uncover  additional  thyroid  function-related genes  previously  unreported  in  GWAS,  to  prioritize potentially  causal  genes  in  TSH-  and  FT4-associated GWAS  loci,  to  contrast  different  tissues  of  the  HPT axis, and  to  characterize  the  identified  associations through  a  series  of  downstream  analyses.  Here,  we unravel  new  thyroid  function-related  genes,  reflecting the increased power of TWAS and PWAS analyses, while also  providing  valuable  insights  into  shared  genetic signals  underlying  transcript  and  protein  levels  and thyroid function levels. The  resulting prioritization of genes in GWAS loci contributes to a better understanding  of  the  genetic  architecture  underlying thyroid  hormone  regulation  and  implicated  numerous previously unreported relationships, such as those for ANXA5 transcript and protein levels.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\n\nGWAS  of  inverse  normal  transformed  values  of  free T4  levels  ( n =  119,120 from  37  cohorts)  revealed  85 independent  significant  SNPs  ( Pvalue  &lt;  5  \u00d710 -8 ),  and of  inverse  normal  transformed  TSH  levels  ( n =  271,040 from 46 cohorts) resulted in 259 independent significant SNPs. All study participants were of European ancestry. Individual study files were filtered by  MAF  &gt;  0.005  and  by  imputation  quality  &gt;  0.4  at the  marker  level.  For  the  meta-analysis,  SNPs  with minor  allele  frequency  (MAF)  &lt;  0.01  or  SNPs  present in &lt;75% of the sample size were excluded. GWAS were performed using genome assembly hg37. Variant identifiers (rsIDs) were annotated and genomic positions were converted to genome assembly GRCh38 (hg38) using the liftOver function from the rtracklayer R package (12).\n\n## Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)\n\nTWAS were performed following the FUSION workflow (13) based on weights from GTEx v8 tissues (European ancestry) considered relevant for thyroid function\n\n(brain hypothalamus,  pituitary, thyroid, and  whole blood). Gene expression weights and linkage disequilibrium (LD) reference data for persons of European  (EUR)  ancestry  from  1000  Genomes  Project (1000G) were downloaded from http://gusevlab.org/ projects/fusion/. Prediction models were based on elastic net modeling (13). Multiple testing was accounted for  by  a  Bonferroni  adjustment  for  the  number  of unique  transcripts  modeled  across  traits  and  tissues ( P -value &lt; 1.74 \u00d7 10 -6 =  0.05/28,768 transcripts). FT3 TWAS was  performed  for  a  selected  candidate  gene, ANXA5 . Overlap  with  significant  GWAS  loci  was  determined using GWAS variants with P -value &lt; 5 \u00d7 10 -8 in a 250 kb window around the TWAS gene.\n\n## Proteome-wide association studies (PWAS)\n\nPWAS  were  performed  based  on  an  adapted  version of  the  FUSION  workflow  ( 13)  using  plasma  protein weights from the European ancestry (EA) subpopulation of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study ( n =  7213)  (ARIC)  (11),  where  plasma  protein  levels  had been  measured  using  the  aptamer-based  Somascan technology (V.4.1 platform). Protein weights and LD reference files were downloaded from http:// nilanjanchatterjeelab.org/pwas/. Prediction models were based on elastic net modeling (13). Multiple testing was accounted for by a Bonferroni adjustment for the number  of  unique  aptamers  modeled  across  traits ( P -value  &lt;  3.78  \u00d7  10 -5 =  0.05  /  1322  aptamers).  Overlap with significant GWAS  loci was determined using GWAS  variants  with P -value  &lt;5  \u00d7  10 -8 in  a  250  kb window around the PWAS gene.\n\n## Conditionally independent colocalization analysis\n\nA  colocalization  analysis  of  independent  signals  was performed for each significant association. Colocalization of TWAS findings was performed using publicly available cis -eQTL  summary  statistics  from  GTEx  v8 (EUR). For PWAS, we used cis -protein quantitative trait loci  (pQTL) summary statistics from EA participants of the  ARIC  study  (11 ).  As  LD  reference  data,  we  used  a subset  of  15,000  genomically  British  participants  from the  UK  Biobank  (application  number  20272);  genomic positions were converted to genome assembly GRCh38 (hg38) using the liftOver function from the rtracklayer R  package  (12).  Plasma  proteins  and  gene  expression summary  statistics were extracted for every gene significant  by  TWAS  or  PWAS  with  a  250  kb  flanking region.  First,  independent  association  signals  within these  regions  were  identified  based  on  approximate conditional  analyses  via  the  GCTA  COJO-Slct  algorithm (14),  with default parameters ( P -value &lt; 5 \u00d7 10 -8 and a collinearity of 0.9). For each conditionally independent SNP,  conditional  summary  statistics  were  computed by  conditioning  on  all  other  independent  SNPs  in  the gene region using the GCTA COJO-Cond algorithm with default parameters (collinearity of 0.9) (14). Subsequently, approximate Bayes factors-based colocalization analyses were conducted for all pairwise combinations of independent  eQTL/pQTL  associations  against  the independent thyroid function GWAS associations (15)  using  an  adapted  version  of  the  Giambartolomei colocalization  method  as  implemented  in  the  'coloc. fast' function (https://github.com/tobyjohnson/gtx), with default  parameters  and  prior  definitions  ( 16).  Positive colocalizations were reported if the posterior probability of a shared causal variant (PPH4/p12) was \u22650.8.\n\n## GO, KEGG, and tissue enrichment analyses\n\nEnrichment  testing  of  the  significant  genes  identified by  TWAS for TSH (297 genes) and for FT4 (113 genes) was performed in different resources using gene ontology  (GO)  terms  (17),  Kyoto  encyclopedia  of  genes and  genomes  (KEGG)  pathways  (18),  Human  protein atlas  (HPA)  tissues  (19),  and  GTEx  v8  tissues  (9),  with highly  expressed  genes  in  each  tissue  defined  as  the top 10% most highly expressed genes. For more details on  the  processing  of  the  tissue  resources,  see  ref.  20. For  all  enrichment  analyses,  we  used  hypergeometric tests implemented  in  the  R  package  clusterProfiler version 4.0.5 (21), where we selected the overlap of the 15,422  genes  encoding  for  transcripts  analyzed  during TWAS  with the genes available in the respective resource as background genes. When testing for enrichment  in  GO  terms  and  KEGG  pathways,  after overlapping with the available genes in the respective resource,  the  gene  set  originating  from  TSH  contained 186 and 95 genes, the gene set originating from FT4  contained  76  and  38  genes,  and  the  number  of background  genes  was  reduced  to  9629  and  4339, respectively. When performing tissue-specific enrichment analyses, the gene set  assigned  to  a  tissue was  filtered  for  genes  encoding  transcripts  analyzed during  TWAS.  All  results  were  filtered  for  terms  with at least two genes. P -values were corrected for multiple testing  using  the  Benjamini-Hochberg  procedure  (22) separately in each of the different resources.\n\n## Investigation of significant genes for associations with human traits and diseases through PheWAS\n\nWe  performed  queries  of  phenome-wide  association results  using  the  AstraZeneca  PheWAS  Portal.  These results  are  based  on  the  UK  Biobank  whole-exome sequencing  data  (469,809  UK  Biobank  exomes)  and contain associations for phenotypes derived from electronic health records, questionnaire data, and continuous  traits  released  by  UK  Biobank  (23).  We limited our queries to gene-level associations to directly  link  them  with  genes  detected  in  our  TWAS (385  genes)  and  PWAS  (28  genes).  Gene-level  analyses\n\nwere  based  on  collapsing  analyses,  which  aggregated rare, putatively deleterious, qualifying variants in each gene  with  given  criteria,  including  ten  dominant  and one recessive model, and testing them against a given phenotype. P -values for binary traits associations were determined by Fisher's exact two-sided test, and P -values for quantitative traits were determined by linear regression corrected for age, sex, and their interaction (age \u00d7 sex). We considered all available binary endpoints ( n =  10,088) and quantitative endpoints ( n =  1927). The total number  of  unique  phenotypes  was n =  14,956. Therefore, we defined the following significance thresholds  for  our  queries: P -value  &lt;  1.19  \u00d7  10 -7 (0.05 /  (28  genes  \u00d7  14,956  phenotypes))  for  genes  implicated by PWAS, and P -value &lt; 8.68 \u00d7 10 -9 (0.05 / (385 genes \u00d7 14,956 phenotypes)) for those implicated by TWAS. The queries  were  further  filtered  to  retain  binary  traits with more than 100 cases and controls and continuous traits  with  more  than  30  observations.  Additionally, the number of cases or controls with qualifying variants  in binary  phenotypes  and  the  number  of participants  with  qualifying  variants  in  quantitative phenotypes had to exceed 3.\n\n## Results\n\n## TWAS reveal expressed genes related to thyroid hormone metabolism\n\nWe performed an HPT axis tissue-specific TWAS based  on  gene  expression  models  derived  from  GTEx project v8 data (Supplementary Table 1, see section on supplementary materials given at the end of this article) (9,  13)  and  GWAS  summary  statistics  of  TSH  and  FT4 derived  from  up  to  271,040  individuals  of  European ancestry across 46 predominantly  population-based cohorts  from  the  ThyroidOmics  Consortium  (Fig.  1). Each transcript was predicted using tissue-specific gene  expression  information,  which  allowed  for  the identification  of  genetic  variants  associated  with  gene expression levels in the relevant tissue (i.e. hypothalamus, pituitary,  thyroid,  and  whole  blood).  Across  tissues, TWAS  yielded  297  and  113  transcripts  significantly associated  with  TSH  and  FT4,  respectively  (Fig.  2).  A total of 25  transcripts  were  significantly  associated with both hormones. Of these, 20 transcripts exhibited inverse  associations,  meaning  that  their  correlation with TSH was opposite to that with FT4 (Supplementary Fig. 1A and Supplementary  Table 2). The thyroid gland yielded the highest number of significant findings across all studied tissues, accounting  for  76.8%  of significant findings from TWAS of TSH and 64.6% from TWAS  of  FT4  (Fig.  2,  Supplementary  Fig.  1B,  C  and Supplementary Table 2).\n\nFrom  the  297  unique  transcripts  associated  with  TSH in one or more tissues, 24 were not encoded by a gene mapping into a significant GWAS  locus. Likewise, the  genes  encoding  14  out  of  the  113  significant  FT4associated  transcripts  did  not  map  into  a  significant\n\nGWAS  locus  (Methods,  Supplementary  Table  2).  Thus, TWAS enabled a gain in power to detect novel thyroid function-associated signals due to the reduced multiple testing  burden  of  gene-based  analysis  as  opposed  to variant-based analysis.\n\nTo assess whether the implicated transcripts represented a molecular link between genetic variation and  TSH  or  FT4  levels  or  independent  associations  in the  same  genetic  region,  we  performed  conditional genetic colocalization analyses. Strong  evidence  for colocalization, i.e. the posterior probability of a shared underlying  causal  variant  (PPH4  &gt;  0.8;  Methods),  was identified  between  thyroid  function  (GWAS)  and  gene expression for 158 (TSH) and 45 (FT4) transcripts in at least  one  of  the  studied  tissues  (Fig.  2,  Supplementary Figs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and Supplementary Table 3). These colocalization  results  are  consistent  with  regions  in which regulatory  variants  affect  both  gene  expression and thyroid function, thereby enabling the prioritization of potentially causal genes in the GWAS loci.\n\nReassuringly,  significant  findings  from  TWAS  of  TSH and FT4 contained multiple positive controls, i.e., transcripts encoded by genes known to have important roles in thyroid hormone  regulation.  For  example, TPO , encoding  the  TH-synthesizing  enzyme  thyroid peroxidase, and PDE8B , encoding phosphodiesterase 8B that catalyzes cAMP hydrolysis, a key second messenger in  TSH  signaling,  were  associated  with  both  TSH  and FT4. Testing for colocalization confirmed  a  shared genetic signal underlying both higher thyroid TPO and PDE8B expression  and  higher  levels  of  TSH,  as  well as  lower  levels  of  FT4  (Supplementary  Fig.  10).  In  line with  known  physiology,  the  colocalization  of  TSH  and FT4 GWAS signals with gene expression was present in thyroid  tissue,  but  not  in  the  hypothalamus,  pituitary, or whole blood. Along the same lines, the colocalization of  transcript  levels  of  the  TSH  receptor  encoding  for the gene TSHR with  TSH was present solely in thyroid tissue. This finding is in line with the fact that the TSH receptor is  predominantly expressed (9) and exerts its main function on the thyroid, as the TWAS of FT4 did not show a significant association (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 3).\n\n## Tissue-specific differential CAPZB expression links independent genetic variants to altered TSH levels\n\nWe  observed  a  significant  association  for CAPZB in both  thyroid-specific  ( P -value = 2.02  \u00d7  10 -215 )  as  well  as pituitary-specific  ( P -value = 1.57  \u00d7  10 -15 )  TWAS  of  TSH (Fig. 3). CAPZB expression models were unavailable for hypothalamus-  and  whole  blood-specific  TWAS  due  to the lack of significant heritability of the eQTL in these datasets. Nevertheless, colocalization analyses between GWAS and  gene  expression  could  be  conducted  in  all HPT  tissues. These  analyses  revealed  colocalization between  genetically higher TSH  levels and higher levels of CAPZB expression in both thyroid (PPH4 = 0.99)\n\nFigure 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWorkflow of integrated transcriptome and proteome-wide association studies of thyroid hormones TSH and FT4.\n\nand  hypothalamus  (PPH4 = 0.89).  A  moderately  strong colocalization  signal  (PPH4 = 0.75)  between  genetically higher TSH levels and higher levels of CAPZB expression in the pituitary was also identified. Interestingly, independent  TSH-associated  genetic  variants  seemed to differentially modulate CAPZB expression in a tissuedependent  manner,  as  shown  in  Fig.  3A:  whereas  a TSH-associated  genetic  signal  upstream  of CAPZB also underlies differential CAPZB expression in the thyroid, another  independent  genetic  signal  centered  on  the gene  body  underlies  differential CAPZB expression  in hypothalamus.\n\nTo further substantiate the regulatory potential of these  variants,  we  analyzed  functional  genomics  data from  thyroid  tissue  generated  by  the  ENCODE  Project Consortium and found that rs10799824, the implicated variant  upstream  of CAPZB , overlapped  with  open chromatin  (ATAC-seq).  Notably,  this  position  was  not accessible in other tissues from the same tissue donor (ENCDO451RUA)  ( Fig. 3B ), supporting tissue-specific regulatory  function.  These  findings  were  confirmed in  thyroid  tissue  of  a  different  donor  (ENCDO793LXB) (Methods,  Supplementary  Fig.  11A).  We  looked  into PheWeb using 1400 EHR-derived broad phenome-\n\nA\n\nB\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Figure 2\n\nResults of tissue-specific TWAS analyses.

To investigate potential relationships between the genes identified through our TWAS approach and rare damaging  variants  associated with thyroid disease, we  investigated  the  individual  and  aggregated  effects of  rare,  putatively  damaging  genetic  variants  across the exome using whole-exome sequencing and clinical  outcome  data  from  the  UK  Biobank  (23),  as implemented in the AZ Portal (Methods).  Our  analysis revealed  significant  associations  for  the  TSH  receptor gene with endocrine  and  metabolic diseases, such as hypothyroidism.  We  identified  other  associations described  in  Supplementary  Fig.  12,  Supplementary Tables 4 and 5.\n\n## Pathway enrichment for TWAS findings\n\nWe  next  performed  overrepresentation  analyses  for genes  encoding  for  significantly  associated  transcripts from  TWAS  using  GO  and  KEGG  databases  to  identify enriched pathways (Methods). For TSH, enriched biological processes (GO) and metabolic pathways (KEGG) were related to growth factors, cAMPmediated  signaling,  and  cAMP  biosynthetic  process. Additionally,  genes  encoding  for  associated  transcripts were  overrepresented  in  morphine  addiction,  relaxin signaling pathway, dopaminergic synapse, and chemical carcinogenesis, among others (Supplementary Fig. 13A and Supplementary Table 6). For FT4, enriched molecular functions  and  biological  processes  (GO),  as  well  as metabolic pathways (KEGG), were related to metabolic processes,  thyroid  hormone  generation,  metabolism, and signaling, as well as chemical carcinogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 13B and Supplementary Table 6).\n\nOverrepresentation analyses to identify tissues in which  the  target  transcripts  were  highly  expressed (Methods)  revealed  thyroid  tissue  for  both  TSH  and FT4  and  additionally  minor  salivary  gland  for  TSH (Supplementary Table 7). These results provide evidence  that  transcripts  implicated  by  TWAS  of  TSH and  FT4  are  indeed  involved  in  molecular  pathways that  are  relevant  to  thyroid  function  and  molecular metabolism, including TSH and FT4 regulation.\n\n## PWAS reveal plasma proteins related to thyroid function\n\nPWAS revealed significant associations between genetically predicted levels of 18 plasma proteins\n\n(Methods)  with  TSH  and  10  with  FT4.  Two  proteins, protein HEXIM1 and Sulfhydryl oxidase 2 (QSOX2), were associated with both hormones (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig.  14A  and  Supplementary  Table  8).  Evidence  for  a shared  causal  variant  from  colocalization  testing  was observed  for  five  TSH-  and  five  FT4-related  proteins (Supplementary Table 9). Although HEXIM1 and Sulfhydryl  oxidase  2  were  not  among  the  proteins  for which  colocalization  was  observed,  dedicated  testing for colocalization with gene expression showed  a shared genetic signal underlying FT4 levels and QSOX2 expression  in  both  thyroid  and  pituitary  (PPH4 = 0.969 and 0.968, respectively).\n\nFrom all significant plasma proteins detected by PWAS  of  thyroid  function,  the  genes  encoding  for  5 and  7  proteins  did  not  map  into  a  significant  GWAS locus for TSH  and  FT4,  respectively  (see  Methods, Supplementary  Table  8).  Details  about  the  function  of these novel TH-related candidates are summarized in  Supplementary  Table  10  (TSH)  and  Supplementary Table 11 (FT4).\n\nThere  were  11  significant  shared  findings  between PWAS  and  TWAS:  10  with  TWAS  of  TSH,  including HEXIM1,  and  one  with  TWAS  of  FT4  (Supplementary Fig.  14B  and  C),  providing  evidence  for  a  molecular chain  connecting  genetic  variation,  gene  expression, and protein levels with thyroid function. In particular, ANXA5  (annexin  A5)  showed  colocalization  between TSH-associated genetic variants with both their plasma protein  and  their  gene  expression  levels  in  HPT  axis tissues (Supplementary Table 12).\n\n## Annexin A5 is inversely associated with TSH levels\n\nWe observed a significant inverse association between plasma levels of  annexin  A5  and  TSH  (PWAS P -value =  1.18 \u00d7 10 -13 ), and an inverse association between TSH and ANXA5 expression in the hypothalamus (TWAS P -value = 6.40 \u00d7 10 -13 ), pituitary (TWAS P -value = 1.57  \u00d7  10 -15 ),  thyroid  (TWAS P -value = 4.27  \u00d7  10 -15 ), and  whole  blood  (TWAS P -value = 7.61  \u00d7  10 -12 ).  These findings  were  supported  by  colocalization  testing:  we observed  colocalization  between  TSH  GWAS  and  both annexin A5 plasma protein levels and gene expression in  all  studied  tissues,  with  lower  TSH  levels  related to  higher  protein  and  expression  levels.  In  line  with these  findings,  colocalization  between  plasma  protein and  gene  expression  levels  was  also  observed  with  a positive correlation (Fig. 5A).\n\nAnnexin A5 (Anxa A5, annexin V) is a member of the Ca 2+ -dependent phospholipid-binding protein family of annexins,  functioning  as  a  membrane  stabilizer. Once the membrane is bound, the function of annexins can vary: some members of the annexin family act in vesicle  trafficking  or  membrane  organization  ( 1,  25). Furthermore,  annexins,  including  annexin  A5,  have been  described  to  function  as  a  Ca 2+   channel  under certain conditions (25 ).  The  latter  finding  is  of  interest\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Figure 4\n\nResults of plasma PWAS analyses.

(B) Simplified conceptual model of annexin A5 exhibiting calcium channel activity in thyroid cells. Calcium is required for the H202 formation in the iodination process in the presence of NADPH, O2, dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2), and thyroid peroxidase (TPO). Subsequently, iodination of tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin (TG) takes place to form, after coupling, the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. * indicates a significant association found in TWAS.

Image created with BioRender .com.\n\nbecause  calcium  is  required  in  the  iodination  process and H2O2 production to form thyroid hormones (1). Additionally, a previous  study  showed  that  on continuous  daily  administration  of  calcium  channel blockers, a gradual fall in levels of T3 and T4 with a rise in TSH levels was observed in rabbits (26). Our results showed a positive although non-significant association between  FT4  and  FT3  levels  and ANXA5 expression in  the  thyroid  (TWAS P -value = 1.27  \u00d7  10 -02 and  TWAS P -value = 1.02  \u00d7  10 -01 , respectively),  and  a  significant inverse  relation  between  thyroid ANXA5 expression levels and  TSH,  consistent with  stimulation of TH production  in  presence  of  annexin  A5  and  displaying the negative feedback loop (Fig. 5b).\n\n## Connecting PWAS discoveries to rare thyroid-related variants using PheWAS\n\nWe  investigated whether  rare putatively damaging variants in the cognate genes of plasma proteins identified in PWAS  showed  significant associations across  a  broad  range  of  clinical  traits  and  diseases. We identified potential connections between rare variants in the genes encoding for plasma protein levels whose  predicted  levels  were  significantly  associated with  thyroid  traits  in  PWAS  (Supplementary  Fig.  15, Supplementary  Tables 13 and 14). Gene-phenotype associations were observed for PSCK1 (from FT4 analyses) with higher fat mass, weight, and phenotypes related to body mass index. Additionally, plasma levels of peptide YY (PYY), a gut hormone involved in appetite regulation and obesity, were also associated with PSCK1 (27). PSCK1 encodes the prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), a serine endoprotease responsible for processing precursor proteins as pro-neuropeptides and  prohormones  (28).  Moreover, IHH identified  by PWAS of FT4, was associated with respiratory function and  height-related  phenotypes.  It  encodes  a  signaling molecule  associated  with  the  regulation  of  skeletal growth  and  development,  phenotypes  influenced  by thyroid  hormones.  Lastly, HGFAC , which  encodes  a protease  that  activates  the  hepatocyte  growth  factor hormone  revealed  in  the  FT4  PWAS,  was  associated with  sex  hormone-binding  globulin  (SHBG).  Thyroid hormones  (T3  and  T4)  were  shown  to  act  indirectly to  increase  SHBG  production  in  the  liver  (29),  and could thus be part of the pathway from HGFAC expression to SHBG levels.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis  systematic  study  of  the  relation  of  genetically predicted tissue-specific levels of gene expression and  the  plasma  proteome  with  the  most  commonly quantified thyroid function-related hormones, TSH and FT4,  has  several  principal  findings:  first,  we  identified thyroid function-associated transcripts and  proteins that are missed by conventional GWAS even at sample sizes well over 250,000 individuals. Secondly, the analyses can help prioritize genes in GWAS  loci, including previously identified loci. Thirdly, conditional colocalization analyses increased confidence in candidates  that  share  a  genetic  basis  with  TH  and provided information about tissue-specific and tissue-shared  effects  on  gene  expression.  Functional annotation of candidate variants implicated a potentially causal,  TSH-related  regulatory  variant  driving CAPZB expression  in  the thyroid. Fourthly, shared  genetic causes of transcript, protein, and TSH levels support the role of annexin A5 in TH regulation.\n\nIn  comparison  to  a  prior  TWAS  study  focusing  on TSH (30),  our  expanded  study  involved  a  much  larger underlying GWAS  and incorporated PWAS  of the plasma  proteome,  revealing  a  comprehensive  set  of transcripts and proteins associated with both TSH and FT4 levels. Our results confirmed most of the previously reported associations but also revealed new ones, thus contributing  to  a  broader  understanding  of  thyroid function and expanding current knowledge.\n\nWe specifically selected those tissues in which genes that influence thyroid status and disease are predominantly expressed. For TWAS, we, therefore, focused on tissues within the HPT axis (2), namely hypothalamic, pituitary, and thyroid tissue, to examine thyroid hormone production,  as  well  as  whole  blood,  which  gives  a systemic  view  and  can  capture  genetic  influences  on thyroid  function  that  might  be  reflected  in  peripheral tissues. Most  of  the  significant  transcripts  for  both TSH  and  FT4  were  found  in  the  thyroid,  which  may partially be  attributable  to  a  higher  availability  of transcript  models  for  thyroid  TWAS  due  to  a  larger eQTL sample size for the thyroid compared to the hypothalamus  and  pituitary  in  the  GTEx  data. Additionally, it should  be  noted  that the observed number of transcripts associated in the thyroid with  TSH  and  FT4  cannot  be  directly  compared  to hypothalamus  and  pituitary  tissue,  as  the  latter  two have  a  more  complex  cell  type  composition  and  play a  role  in  regulating  different  hormones  (31).  Namely, the  hypothalamus  has  a  complex  and  heterogeneous population of neurons and glial cells that regulate also other endocrine axes, which can affect thyroid-related gene  expression  (32).  Similarly,  the  pituitary  gland  is composed  of  different  hormone-producing  cell  types, with  TSH-secreting  thyrotropes  making  up  less  than 10% of the cells in the gland (33).\n\nOur  results  also  underline  the  link  between  thyroid hormones  and  trace  elements  by  identifying  not  only DIO1  and  DIO2  but  also  the  Se  transport  receptor LRP8 and the selenoprotein-specific translational regulator SECISBP2L. These findings are not only consistent  with  the  well-studied  role  of  iodine  but also selenium in thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism (34, 35). This points toward potential tissue-specific links, motivating further studies in experimental models.\n\n## CAPZB - different SNPs related to different tissues\n\nSix  independent  variants  in  the CAPZB locus  were identified  in  the  TSH  GWAS.  Of  these,  the  intronic SNPs  rs12042004  and  rs10799824  upstream  of CAPZB colocalize  with  gene  expression  in  the  hypothalamus and thyroid, respectively. In agreement with a potential regulatory  role  in  the  thyroid,  rs10799824  maps  into an open chromatin peak in the thyroid but not in other studied  tissues. CAPZB encodes  the  \u03b2-subunit  of  the capping  protein  involved  in  TSH-induced  engulfment of  the  colloid  by  extension  of  microvilli  and  filopodia, representing a key step for thyroglobulin mobilization and subsequent proteolysis of thyroid hormones, including T3 and T4, in the thyroid gland (36). Given the location of rs10799824 in the thyroidspecific  open  chromatin  peak,  it  could  affect  thyroidspecific  gene  expression  of CAPZB ,  e.g.  via  differential transcription  factor  binding,  leading  to  differences  in the  amount  of  produced  thyroid  hormones.  In  turn, these  differences  could  cause  changes  in  the  observed variation of TSH via the negative feedback mechanism by T3 and T4.\n\n## Annexin A5 function in thyroid hormone production\n\nWe described a conceptual model regarding the function of annexin A5 in thyroid hormone production based  on  the  inverse  association  of  TSH  levels  and ANXA5 expression in thyroid and other HPT-axis tissues. A reverse association, namely an effect of TSH levels  on  annexin  A5  levels,  has  also  been  described: previous literature in pigs and rats have shown that  annexin  A5  levels  are  dependent  on  the  cAMP pathway  in  thyroid  cells,  and  that  concentrations  and localization of annexin proteins are under TSH control via this similar pathway, resulting in higher expression of  annexins  mediated  by  TSH-induced  cAMP  (37,  38). Conversely, TSH-stimulated thyroid cells from rats were inversely associated with ANXA5 expression (39 ).  Our  study  also  showed  novel  findings  regarding ANXA5 expression  in  the  other  HPT-axis  tissues  and whole blood, as well as a relation of annexin A5 plasma levels  with  lower  TSH  levels  and  higher  FT4  and  FT3 levels. Recent  studies supporting  these associations of ANXA5 expression  and  protein  levels  on  TSH  levels in  thyroid-related  tissues  are  sparse.  However,  given the  tight  relation  between  the  different  tissues  in  the HPT-axis, it can be expected that the associations with TSH  (and  FT4)  are  present  also  in  hypothalamic  and pituitary tissue, but that these are driven by the effect of ANXA5 in the thyroid. The PWAS findings are consistent with  the  high  abundance  of  annexin  A5  in  plasma as a reflection of the general function of annexins.\n\n## PheWAS supports the relation of PCSK1 to FT4 levels\n\nPheWAS of thyroid function-associated genes identified by  PWAS  revealed  associations  between  rare  genetic variants in PCSK1 and several anthropometric phenotypes, as well as association with PYY, a hormone related to appetite regulation. Rare mutations in PCSK1 are  known  to  result  in  a  loss  of  the  encoded enzyme's  autocatalytic  cleavage  ability,  leading  to  a variable pleiotropic syndrome that can include obesity (40), malabsorption diarrhea, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, growth hormone  deficiency, altered thyroid and  adrenal  function, or impaired  glucose regulation  (28, 41). With  regard  to  altered  thyroid function,  patients  with PCSK1 mutations  demonstrate (mild) central hypothyroidism with low FT4 levels and normal  to  low  TSH  levels.  This  is  in  agreement  with our  PWAS  findings  that  show  a  significant  association between PCSK1 -encoded plasma protein levels and  FT4  levels,  denoting  that  both  rare  and  common variants  in  the  gene  relate  to  functions  of  the  thyroid (Supplementary Tables 8 and 11).\n\n## Study strengths and limitations\n\nTWAS  and  PWAS  are  important  approaches  for  genebased prioritization and for delivering potential mechanistic information by revealing a possible correlation between gene expression or protein levels  and  a  trait.  As  exemplified  in  this  study  on  TSH and  FT4,  which  are  key  players  in  the  HPT-axis,  this approach  could  also  be  of  interest  to  other  axes  in endocrinology.  Similarly,  combining  TWAS  and  PWAS with  available  GWAS  data  could  be  used  to  identify the molecular underpinnings of endocrine circuits. For instance,  cortisol,  a  key  player  in  the  hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis (42), or GWAS data of luteinizing hormone  and follicle-stimulating hormone  as part of  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal  axis  (43),  can provide  valuable  insights  into  the  underlying  genetic architecture. However, it is important to keep in mind that co-regulation of gene expression or protein levels, as well as predicted expression correlations and shared variants between expression weight models, can induce bias  and therefore lead to false positive signals (7). To mitigate  this  potential  bias,  we  included  a  conditional colocalization analysis step and confirmed that several candidate transcripts and proteins revealed by the TWAS and PWAS have a shared causal variant with TSH and FT4 levels. Additionally, the ability of TWAS and PWAS approaches  to  establish  directionality  in  the  observed associations  is  limited.  While  these  approaches  enable the identification of potential  causal  links  between genetically regulated transcript and protein levels with TSH and FT4 levels, it  does  not  ascertain  which  is  the cause  and  which  is  the  consequence.  Experimental\n\nvalidations are needed to unravel the temporal sequence of these associations accurately.\n\nTaking  into  account  the  importance  of  T3  in  thyroid function,  larger  GWAS  on  this  hormone  are  needed  to also  include  T3  as  an  outcome  in  powerful  PWAS  and TWAS  analyses.  Lastly,  the  underlying  GWAS  solely incorporated information from individuals of European descent. We used matching transcript and protein level models  derived  from  persons  of  European  ancestry, but our findings may therefore not be generalizable to other ancestries.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn  summary,  we  performed  well-powered  association studies of genetically inferred, tissue-specific transcripts as well as plasma  protein  levels  with  the  thyroid function parameters TSH and FT4 levels. We identified novel thyroid function-associated genes, including those outside significant GWAS  loci. Tissue-specific colocalization  analysis  revealed  associations  between a  thyroid-specific  regulatory  variant,  rs10799824,  and CAPZB levels. Furthermore, we developed a conceptual framework consistent with the calcium channel activity  of  annexin  A5  in  thyroid  cells,  revealed  by inverse,  colocalization-supported  associations  between ANXA5 transcript  and  protein  levels  with  TSH  levels. Our  findings contribute to a better understanding of transcriptional regulation and protein levels relevant  to  thyroid  hormone  regulation.  Finally,  our approach  can  be  used  as  a  conceptual  blueprint  for other endocrine axes.\n\n## Supplementary materials\n\nThis is linked to the online version of the paper at https://doi.org/10.1530/ ETJ-24-0067.\n\n## Declaration of interest\n\nMM is on the Editorial Board of European Thyroid Journal .

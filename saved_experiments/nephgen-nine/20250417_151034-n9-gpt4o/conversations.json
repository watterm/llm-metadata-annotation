All analyses were adjusted for clinical and demographic covariates, including for baseline eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) in longitudinal analyses.\n\nResults At visit 5 of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, the mean age of participants was 76 years (SD 6); 56% were women, mean eGFR was 62 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 20), and median UACR level was 13 mg/g (interquartile range, 25). In cross-sectional analysis, 675 serum and 542 urine metabolites were associated with eGFR (Bonferroni-corrected P , 4.0E-5 for serum analyses and P , 3.6E-5 for urine analyses), including 248 metabolites shared across bio /uniFB02 uids. Fewer metabolites (75 serum and 91 urine metabolites, including seven metabolites shared across bio /uniFB02 uids) were cross-sectionally associated with albuminuria. Guanidinosuccinate; N2,N2-dimethylguanosine; hydroxy-N6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine; X-13844; and X-25422 were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with both eGFR and albuminuria. Over a mean follow-up of 6.6 years, serum mannose (hazard ratio [HR], 2.3 [1.6 -3.2], P 5 2.7E-5) and urine X-12117 (HR, 1.7 [1.3 -2.2], P 5 1.9E-5) were risk factors of UACR doubling, whereas urine sebacate (HR, 0.86 [0.80 -0.92], P 5 1.9E-5) was inversely associated. Compared with clinical characteristics alone, including the top /uniFB01 ve endogenous metabolites in serum and urine associated with longitudinal outcomes improved the outcome prediction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for eGFR decline: clinical model 5 0.79, clinical 1 metabolites model 5 0.87, P 5 8.1E-6; for UACR doubling: clinical model 5 0.66, clinical 1 metabolites model 5 0.73, P 5 2.9E-5).\n\nConclusions Metabolomic pro /uniFB01 ling in different bio /uniFB02 uids provided distinct and potentially complementary insights into the biology and prognosis of kidney diseases.\n\nJASN 35: 1252 -1265, 2024. doi: https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.0000000000000403\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe kidney is an organ that interfaces between blood and urine, and its function is quanti /uniFB01 ed by the accumulation and /uniFB02 ow of small molecules or metabolites across bio /uniFB02 uids. eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) are two metrics commonly used to quantify kidney function and injury, with both metrics incorporating creatinine, a small molecule that is both /uniFB01 ltered and secreted by the kidney. Low eGFR and high UACR levels are associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes, such as kidney failure and mortality. 1 4 -\n\nMetabolomics refers to the large-scale identi /uniFB01 cation and quanti /uniFB01 cation of metabolites in biological systems. This tool, to date primarily implemented in blood, has allowed for the discovery of circulating biomarkers associated with clinical outcomes, such as CKD. 5 8 -Given the kidney s role in ' /uniFB01 ltration, both serum and urine metabolomic investigations may inform the study of kidney diseases.\n\nDue to the number of contributing authors, the affiliations are listed at the end of this article.\n\nCorrespondence: Dr. Morgan E. Grams or Dr. Pascal Schlosser, email: Morgan.Grams@nyulangone.org or pascal.schlosser@uniklinik-freiburg.de\n\nReceived: February 16, 2024 Accepted: May 29, 2024 Published Online Ahead of Print: June 6, 2024\n\nIn addition to creatinine, other serum or urine-based metabolites may add information regarding kidney function, injury, or prognosis.\n\nA few previous kidney metabolomic studies have considered metabolites pro /uniFB01 led within serum and urine, but sample size or the metabolomic platform was limited or data restricted to blood levels. 9 14 -In this study, we aimed to identify non-drug serum and urine metabolites that were crosssectionally associated with eGFR or UACR, as well as metabolites that were longitudinally associated with a 40% decline in eGFR or UACR doubling in a large general population cohort. We assessed these associations using the same high-throughput metabolomics platform for 1255 and 1398 metabolites in serum and urine, respectively. We also aimed to assess whether including serum, urine, or both sets of metabolites with clinical variables can improve the performance of models predicting kidney function decline.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Study Population\n\nThe Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study is an ongoing study that began in 1987 that aims to investigate causes and clinical consequences of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases with respect to demographic characteristics. 15 The study recruited 15,792 participants aged between 45 and 64 years at enrollment (visit 1) from four communities (Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; Minneapolis suburbs, MN; and Washington County, MD).\n\nOur study population was drawn from the 6538 ARIC participants who attended visit 5 (2011 -2013). To be included in the current analyses, we required that participants had non-missing eGFRcr,cys ( n 5 101 excluded), were in either the White or Black race category ( n 5 18 excluded), had no prevalent kidney failure ( n 5 36 excluded), and had both serum and urine metabolite data available with at least 50% detectable endogenous metabolites (Supplemental Figure 1). This selection resulted in a study sample of 1612 participants used in cross-sectional analyses.\n\nFor the longitudinal analyses with a 40% decline in eGFR or UACR doubling, we required that participants had at least one follow-up visit at visit 6 (2016 -2017) or 7 (2018 -2019) with non-missing eGFR or UACR data. This resulted in 942 individuals in our study population for the decline in eGFR analysis and 894 individuals for the doubling in UACR analyses. ARIC conducted active surveillance and is linked to mortality and the United States Renal Data System registries.\n\nTo assess whether including serum, urine, or both sets of metabolites improved prediction of eGFR decline or UACR doubling beyond clinical variables, individuals common to both longitudinal study samples were included ( n 5 879).\n\nReplication of longitudinal analyses were conducted in the ongoing prospective German Chronic Kidney Disease (GCKD) study, which began in 2010 and enrolled 5217 adult individuals with CKD. 16 Inclusion criteria encompassed patients regularly visited by nephrologists, with an eGFR between 30 and 60 ml min 2 1 per 1.73 m 2 or an eGFR . 60 ml min 2 1 per 1.73 m 2 along with UACR . 300 mg per gram (or urinary protein-creatinine ratio . 500 mg per gram). The GCKD study was registered in the national clinical studies registry (DRKS 00003971) and received approval from the local ethics committees at participating institutions (universities or medical faculties of Aachen, Berlin, Erlangen, Freiburg, Hannover, Heidelberg, Jena, Munchen, and Wurzburg). \u0308 \u0308 All participants provided written informed consent.\n\n## Metabolomic Profiling and Preprocessing\n\nSerum and urine samples stored at 2 80\u00b0C were sent to Metabolon, Inc. (Durham, NC) for untargeted metabolite pro /uniFB01 ling by liquid chromatography -mass spectroscopy (serum pro /uniFB01 led in 2019, urine pro /uniFB01 led in 2022). A total of 1464 serum metabolites (including 320 unnamed and 302 drug metabolites) and 1581 urine metabolites (including 467 unnamed and 382 drug metabolites) were identi /uniFB01 ed and quanti /uniFB01 ed. Metabolites were categorized into ten superpathways by Metabolon, namely amino acid, carbohydrate, cofactors and vitamins, energy, lipid, nucleotide, partially characterized molecules, peptide, unknown, and xenobiotics. Drug metabolites were excluded from our analyses (serum: 302 metabolites, urine: 382 metabolites). The preprocessing steps for serum and urine data were conducted in parallel.\n\nFirst, for both serum and urine data, each metabolite was batch normalized to account for minor instrument variations between batches per manufacturer protocol (Metabolon, Inc.). Missing values were imputed with the minimum observed value for endogenous and unnamed metabolites present in more than 20% of samples.\n\nFor urine data only, we accounted for the varying dilutions between samples using probability quotient (PQ) normalization. 17 In the context of urine metabolomics, PQ normalization operates by /uniFB01 nding a most probable dilution factor estimated from a low-missingness subset of metabolites to normalize each sample. We estimated our PQ factors for normalization on the basis of all 372 endogenous metabolites with , 1% missing sample measurements. The PQ factors were computed with the nonimputed data of these metabolites and then used to normalize the samples for the imputed urine data. In Supplemental Figure 2, we provide a plot of the PQ factors against urinary creatinine, the reference that is used clinically. 18,19\n\nFor both serum and urine data, we then rescaled each metabolite to have a median of 1 and then log2 transformed the metabolites to reduce skewness. Metabolites with variance # 0.01 were removed, and endogenous and unnamed metabolites were winsorized at 5 SDs. Finally, we excluded any metabolites with . 80% missing sample measurements.\n\nThe /uniFB01 nal dataset consisted of 1255 serum metabolites and 1398 urine metabolites, with 721 metabolites detected in both bio /uniFB02 uids.\n\nGCKDmetabolomics were quanti /uniFB01 ed from stored EDTA plasma and spot urine. Preprocessing was conducted analogously, except for winsorization, which was not performed. 20 The /uniFB01 nal dataset for the selected plasma and urine metabolites consisted of 4744 individuals with complete data.\n\n## Covariates\n\nStudy center included four categories as mentioned earlier: Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; Minneapolis suburbs, MN;andWashington County, MD. Diabetes was de /uniFB01 ned as having a blood glucose level of $ 140 mg/dl after a fasting\n\nperiod of $ 8 hours or a nonfasting blood glucose level of $ 200 mg/dl, a self-reported clinical diagnosis of diabetes, or taking medications for diabetes or high blood glucose. Systolic BP was determined using the average of the second and third sitting BP measurements of three total measurements that were taken 5 minutes apart with no change in posture. Prevalent coronary heart disease was de /uniFB01 ned as having prevalent myocardial infarction from adjudicated electrocardiogram data in visit 5, diagnosed myocardial infarction, or a history of coronary bypass or angioplasty of a coronary artery/arteries. Age, sex, race, and smoking status (current smoker, former smoker, never smoked, or unknown) were self-reported. The use of hypertension medications was ascertained by inspection of medications taken in the previous 2 weeks. The race-free 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation 21 was used to calculate the eGFR for each visit using both serum creatinine and cystatin C. Creatinine was measured using the Roche enzymatic method, whereas cystatin C was measured by immunoturbidimetry. Urine albumin (used to calculate urine albumin-creatinine ratios [UACR], i.e ., albuminuria) at each visit was quanti /uniFB01 ed by immunoturbidimetry from random urine samples. Total cholesterol, weight, and height (the latter two used to de /uniFB01 ne body mass index) were measured during visit 5. GCKD used the 2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation based on serum creatinine. 22\n\n## Statistical Analysis\n\nBaseline characteristics of the study population were summarized using means and SDs or medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for skewed distributions and for continuous variables, respectively. Categorical variables were summarized with counts and proportions. To characterize the serum and urine metabolome on a descriptive level before integrating kidney function, metabolites were sorted by their superpathways and the Spearman correlations between all pairs of metabolites were calculated. The median correlations by superpathway were then calculated excluding paired serum -serum and urine -urine metabolites that have a correlation of 1. Summary statistics of the correlations by superpathways for paired serum -urine metabolites were separately reported.\n\nIn the cross-sectional analyses to investigate associations between metabolites within each bio /uniFB02 uid and eGFR or log2(UACR), sequentially adjusted multiple linear regression models were implemented: model 1 adjusted for demographics only, that is, age, sex, race, and study center; model 2 adjusted additionally for body mass index, systolic BP, diabetes, prevalent coronary heart disease, use of hypertension medications, smoking status, and total cholesterol; model 3 adjusted additionally for log2(UACR) when assessing associations with eGFR or eGFR when assessing associations with log2(UACR).\n\nTo assess whether speci /uniFB01 c superpathways were overrepresented among the metabolites that were associated with eGFR or UACR, a permutation test was performed by repeating the regression analyses over all metabolites for a total of 1000 times. 23 Metabolite levels were permuted en bloc to retain the same correlation structure. In other words, the data structure was retained, but eGFR (or UACR)\n\nwas permuted for a total of 1000 permutations. In each permutation, all metabolite regressions were performed. The number of signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites from the original analysis was used to identify the top associations from each permutation. A superpathway was determined to be over-represented if the original number of signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites in the superpathway was greater than the number of signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites in the same superpathway in more than 95% of the permutations ( P , 0.05).\n\nIn the longitudinal analyses to investigate associations between metabolites within each bio /uniFB02 uid and 40% eGFR decline or UACR doubling from visit 5 by visit 7 (mean follow-up time of 6.6 years), three sequentially adjusted logistic regression models were considered as before. Of note, model 3 adjusted for both baseline eGFR and log2(UACR) in both analyses.\n\nMultiple tests were accounted for using a Bonferronicorrected threshold to assess for statistical signi /uniFB01 cance. Signi /uniFB01 cant serum metabolites were de /uniFB01 ned to have P , 0.05/ 1255 5 4.0E-5, whereas signi /uniFB01 cant urine metabolites were de /uniFB01 ned to have P , 0.05/1397 5 3.6E-5.\n\nMetabolites found to be signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with kidney function or kidney function decline were reassessed with model 3 in individuals strati /uniFB01 ed by diabetes status, excluding the diabetes adjustment.\n\nTo investigate whether including both urine and serum metabolites in a logistic model for a 40% decline in eGFR or UACR doubling improved discrimination as compared with clinical covariates, we /uniFB01 rst de /uniFB01 ned a model using clinical covariates described in model 3 of the longitudinal analyses, assessing performance using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Then, we evaluated models with clinical covariates 1 the top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites only, clinical covariates 1 the top /uniFB01 ve urine metabolites only, and clinical covariates 1 the top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites and top /uniFB01 veurine metabolites. The top metabolites were selected from endogenous metabolites with the lowest P values from model 3 of the longitudinal analyses. Model improvement was assessed using the difference in AUC (DeLong test). 24 GCKDanalyses did not include race and center as covariates.\n\n## Results\n\n## Baseline Characteristics of Study Populations\n\nThe study population for the cross-sectional analyses included 1612 participants with a mean age of 76 years (SD 6); 56% were women, 49% were Black, mean eGFR was 62 ml/ min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 20), and median UACR was 13 mg/g (IQR, 25) (Table 1).\n\nFor longitudinal analyses with eGFR decline as the outcome, the study population with 942 participants had a mean age of 75 years (SD 5); 59% were female, 54% were Black, the mean eGFR was 65 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 20), and the median UACR was 10 mg/g (IQR, 18). The mean time between visits was 3.4 years, and 10% ( n 5 97) people developed a 40% decline in eGFR, whereas 33% ( n 5 294) people developed doubling of UACR.\n\n## Metabolite-Metabolite Correlations\n\nIntermetabolite correlation varied across superpathways (Figure 1A).

Metabolites within the xenobiotic superpathway had the highest correlations between serum and urine (median, 0.79; IQR, 0.19) (Figure 2B), potentially indicating the primacy of renal excretion and limited endogenous metabolism for these compounds.\n\n## Cross-Sectional Associations between Serum or Urine Metabolites and Kidney Function\n\nThere were 675 and 542 serum and urine metabolites that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with eGFR (Figure 3, A and B), including 248 shared metabolites. A higher proportion of serum metabolites were inversely associated with eGFR compared with urine metabolites (71% for serum versus 56% for urine), representing accumulation of many metabolites in lower eGFR.\n\nTop metabolites that were higher with lower eGFR included creatinine ( b 52 0.014, P , 1.0E-323), hydroxyasparagine ( b 52 0.020, P , 1.0E-323), 2,3-dihydroxy-5methylthio-4-pentenoic acid ( b 52 0.020, P , 1.0E-323), C-glycosyltryptophan ( b 52 0.020, P , 1.5E-304), and pseudouridine ( b 52 0.018, P , 7.5E-294). All but pseudouridine were classi /uniFB01 ed into the amino acid superpathway. Amino acids and carbohydrates were overrepresented within the signi /uniFB01 cant serum metabolites (Figure 4A).\n\nBy contrast, top urine metabolites included those with negative associations with eGFR, 1-methylguanidine ( b 52 0.031, P 5 6.9E-202), asymmetric dimethylarginine ( b 5 0.013, P 5 5.3E-109), and X-12117 ( b 52 0.024, P 5 9.7E-102) and positive associations with eGFR, ribitol\n\n( b 5 0.014, P 5 5.8E-98), and guanine ( b 5 0.024, P 5 4.4E92). Amino acids and carbohydrates were also found to be over-represented within signi /uniFB01 cant urine metabolites (Figure 4B).\n\n## Cross-Sectional Associations between Serum or Urine Metabolites and Albuminuria\n\nThere were 75 serum and 91 urine metabolites that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with log2(UACR) (Figure 3, C and D), with seven signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites being shared between both bio /uniFB02 uids. For both bio /uniFB02 uids, the number of metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with log2(UACR) were fewer than the number of metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with eGFR. The top /uniFB01 ve signi /uniFB01 -cant serum metabolites cross-sectionally associated with log2(UACR) were 3,5-dichloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid ( b 52 0.15, P 5 2.0E-44); X-24951 ( b 52 0.21, P 5 9.0E-42); 3-bromo-5-chloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid ( b 52 0.13, P 5 2.1E-33); 4-hydroxychlorothalonil ( b 52 0.15, P 5 7.4E-30); and X-11372 ( b 52 0.12, P 5 6.3E-27), and all were negatively correlated with log2(UACR); each of these named metabolites were in the xenobiotic superpathway. Amino acids and carbohydrates were over-represented within signi /uniFB01 cant serum metabolites (Figure 4C).\n\nIn contrast to /uniFB01 ndings in serum, urine lipids were over-represented in metabolite associations with albuminuria (Figure 4D). The top /uniFB01 ve signi /uniFB01 cant urine metabolites included 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-glycerophosphatidylcholine (GPC) (16:0/20:4n6) ( b 5 0.35, P 5 3.2E-117), 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPC (16:0/18:2) ( b 5 0.39, P 5 5.7E-97), 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPC (18:0/18:2) ( b 5 0.39, P 5 2.5E-71), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylGPC (16:0/18:1) ( b 5 0.30, P 5 2.8E-43), and 1-stearoyl-2arachidonoyl-GPE (18:0/20:4) ( b 5 0.13, P 5 5.9E-25), all of which were lipids.\n\nFigure 1. Heat maps of the correlations and median correlations between every serum-urine metabolite pair, organized by superpathways. (A) Correlations between serum metabolites were more positive and generally stronger than correlations between urine metabolites or serum-urine metabolites. (B) Carbohydrates were most positively correlated with each other in serum (median correlation 0.2), urine (median correlation 0.06), and between biofluids (0.07). The strongest negative correlation was between serum carbohydrates and urine nucleotides (median correlation, 20.05). The superpathway abbreviations along the x axis and y axis are amino acid (AA), carbohydrate (Carb), cofactors and vitamins (Vit), energy (E), lipid (Lip), nucleotide (Nuc), partially characterized molecules (PCM), peptide (Pep), unknown (Un), and xenobiotics (Xen).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThere were /uniFB01 ve metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with both eGFR and log2(UACR) in both bio /uniFB02 uids: guanidinosuccinate; N2,N2-dimethylguanosine; hydroxyN6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine; X-13844; and X-25422 (see Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 for their associations). All /uniFB01 ve metabolites had negative associations with eGFR in both serum and urine. On the other hand, they were all positively associated with log2(UACR) in serum. In urine, guanidinosuccinate, X-13844, and X-25422 were positively associated with log2(UACR), whereas N2,N2dimethylguanosine and hydroxy-N6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine were negatively associated with log2(UACR).\n\n## Longitudinal Associations between Serum or Urine Metabolites and Kidney Function Decline\n\nNo serum or urine metabolite was signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with a 40% decline in eGFR at the Bonferroni-corrected threshold ( P for serum 5 4.0E-5, P for urine 5 3.6E-5) (Figure 5, A and B). Serum mannose (hazard ratio [HR] 5 2.3 [1.6 -3.2], P 5 2.7E-5) and urine X-12117 (HR 5 1.7 [1.3 -2.2], P 5 1.9E-5) were positively associated with UACR doubling, whereas urine sebacate (C10-DC) (HR 5 0.86 [0.80 -0.92], P 5 1.9E-5) was inversely associated with UACR doubling (Figure 5, C and D).\n\n## Evaluation of Effect Modification by Diabetes Status\n\nThe associations between metabolites and kidney function, albuminuria, and kidney function decline were comparable regardless of diabetes status (Supplemental Figure 3). On the other hand, several metabolites had higher or lower levels by diabetes status (Supplemental\n\nTable 3). Predictably, sugars and sugar compounds, such as glucose and mannonate, had elevated levels in serum and urine among individuals with diabetes. Several N -lactoyl amino acids previously found to be risk factors of diabetic retinopathy 25 were also elevated in both serum and urine for individuals with diabetes. Serum levels of choline-containing metabolites tended to be lower in participants with diabetes.\n\n## Benefit of Measuring Metabolites in Multiple Biofluids\n\nMetabolites that were detected in both serum and urine were more likely to be associated with eGFR than metabolites that were detected in only one of the bio /uniFB02 uids (84% metabolites detected in serum and urine were signi /uniFB01 cant versus 29% metabolites detected in serum only versus 31% metabolites detected in urine only, chisquared P 5 8.9E-114), indicating the centrality of metabolite excretion in kidney function (Figure 6). Similarly, for associations with albuminuria, more shared metabolites had signi /uniFB01 cant associations compared with those detected in a single bio /uniFB02 uid (16% versus 3% versus 4%, respectively, P 5 1.7E-20). A list of the metabolites that were detected in serum only, urine only, or both serum and urine is presented in Supplemental Table 4.\n\nThe top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites associated with a 40% decline in eGFR were 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG); cysteine s-sulfate; 10-undecenoate (11:1n1); erythronate; and 1-ribosyl-imidazoleacetate, whereas the top /uniFB01 ve urine metabolites were choline; 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate; N -acetylarginine; glycerophosphoethanolamine; and glucuronide of C10H18O2 (2).

Including serum and urine metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly increased the AUC further to 0.87 ( P for difference in AUCs between the clinical model and the clinical 1 serum 1 urine metabolites model 5 8.1E-6).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites associated with UACR doubling were mannose, N -acetylglycine, oleoylcholine, arachidonoylcholine, and g -glutamylcitrulline, whereas the top /uniFB01 ve urine metabolites were sebacate (C10-DC), I-urobilinogen, N -acetylglutamine, N -acetylcitrulline, and tridecenedioate (C13:1-DC). Including serum and urine metabolites in a prediction model of albuminuria doubling increased the AUC from 0.66 (clinical covariates only) to 0.69 (serum metabolites 1 clinical covariates, P for difference in AUC from the clinical covariates only model 5 0.012) and 0.71 (urine metabolites 1 clinical covariates, P for difference in AUC from the clinical covariates only model 5 3.6E-4). Including both serum and urine metabolites increased the AUC to 0.73 ( P for difference in AUC from the clinical covariates -only model 5 2.9E-5). To test the conclusion in an external cohort of participants with CKD, we used the same metabolites quanti /uniFB01 ed in plasma and urine in the GCKD study. Addition of blood or urine metabolomics improved risk prediction in the patients with CKD, albeit to a modest degree. Supplemental Table 5 contains the full equations for each of the above models for longitudinal risk prediction, and Supplemental Table 6 shows the Spearman correlations between the metabolites included in the models.\n\nThis large community-based study identi /uniFB01 es metabolomic correlates and antecedents of kidney parameters and kidney function decline, respectively, and suggests the utility of measuring metabolites in more than one bio /uniFB02 uid. Kidney function had a profound effect on both the circulating metabolome and the urinary metabolome. In addition, novel circulating and urinary metabolites were identi /uniFB01 ed that preceded the decline of kidney function more than 5 years in advance. Moreover, the results suggest that measurement of metabolites from multiple bio /uniFB02 uids can provide distinct and orthogonal insight into kidney disease biology and prognosis.\n\nMost prior metabolomics studies of kidney function have focused on blood metabolites and eGFR. 14,26,27 For example, a previous study discovered 65 circulating metabolites associated with eGFRcr. 14 Of the 65 metabolites, 49 were measured in our study and all displayed signi /uniFB01 cant associations with eGFRcr-cys ( P , 0.05/49), providing face validity. Similarly, several of the top serum metabolites are known markers of /uniFB01 ltration: creatinine, pseudouridine, and C-glycosyltryptophan. 28,29 Other /uniFB01 ndings expand upon the existing literature: Serum guanidinosuccinate, previously associated with kidney failure, was negatively associated with eGFR and positively associated with albuminuria. 30,31 Serum N2,N2dimethylguanosine, a modi /uniFB01 ed ribonucleoside known to be elevated in kidney failure, was associated with worse kidney function and albuminuria doubling. 32 We also found that higher levels of choline and its derivatives, such as trimethylamine N -oxide, were risk factors of kidney function or kidney function decline, although the latter associations were NS at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold. This association is consistent with various studies that have identi /uniFB01 ed choline and its derivatives as markers of renal metabolism 33 that are upregulated in AKI. 34\n\nFigure 3.

UACR, urine albumin-creatinine ratio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur results expand upon previous /uniFB01 ndings by adding metabolomic pro /uniFB01 ling of urine, which has been investigated in markedly fewer studies. Many of the known uremic toxins, or metabolites that accumulate in serum in the setting of low eGFR ( e.g ., urea, indoxyl sulfate, kynurenines), also had negative associations with eGFR in urine. This suggests that for these metabolites, absolute levels of excretion are higher in lower eGFR, albeit insuf /uniFB01 cient to maintain a normal nonelevated level in blood. Notably, higher levels of metabolites in blood could re /uniFB02 ect retention or systemic overproduction. 35\n\nEight of the ten metabolite superpathways were overrepresented in at least one of the four cross-sectional analyses for serum or urine metabolite associations with eGFR or albuminuria. Among the metabolites associated with albuminuria, urinary lipids were over-represented. Several\n\nFigure 4.

Phosphatidylcholines are essential components of biological membranes and critical for LDL and chylomicron assembly. GPCs are also osmolytes that accumulate under hypertonic stress, which can occur in the setting of low kidney function, leading to increased levels of excretion into urine. Their increased presence in urine in the setting of albuminuria may represent damaged cell membranes or coupling with urine albumin because albumin has a high af /uniFB01 nity for lipids. 36 38 -High levels of lipids may also indicate dyslipidemia or abnormal lipid metabolism, which may cause or accelerate lipotoxicity-mediated atherosclerotic renal vascular damage, leading to albuminuria. 39 42 -\n\nMany of the metabolites detected in both serum and urine were associated with eGFR and albuminuria, which may be a direct re /uniFB02 ection of the kidney s role in ' /uniFB01 ltration. The metabolites with highest correlation between serum and urine levels were xenobiotics. Interestingly, most\n\nUrine metabolites\n\nFigure 5.

This may re /uniFB02 ect the fact that urine levels are determined not only by /uniFB01 ltration but also by tubular secretion. Although GFR associates with the secretory clearance of drugs, 43 the relationship can be nonlinear for speci /uniFB01 c solutes, especially in advanced CKD. 44 More likely, however, is that blood levels of intravascular hydration are extraordinarily well regulated, whereas urine has a wide range of dilution that statistical methods ( e.g ., PQ normalization) can only partially address.\n\nIn longitudinal analyses, higher serum mannose and lower urine sebacate was a strong risk factor of increasing albuminuria, quanti /uniFB01 ed by UACR doubling. Previous kidney metabolomic studies have reported positive associations between serum mannose with kidney failure 45\n\nFigure 6.

Urine sebacate is a naturally occurring urine acid, and dibutyl sebacate is a common plasticizer used in the coating of sustained-release drug tablets. 47 -51 Thus, higher levels of urinary sebacate may re /uniFB02 ect use of speci /uniFB01 c medications.\n\nAlthough the aim of this work was not focused on prediction of CKD progression, simple logistic models including either serum metabolites or urine metabolites improved discrimination over a model of clinical covariates only, and the model including both serum and urine metabolites had the best discrimination among all models considered. This /uniFB01 nding was replicated in patients with CKD in the GCKD cohort. Although these /uniFB01 ndings require validation in independent studies, they lend credence to the idea that not only do both bio /uniFB02 uids provide key information in estimating kidney prognosis but also the information they provide is complementary.\n\nThis study re /uniFB02 ects one of the largest to date to use both serum and urine metabolites in the cross-sectional and longitudinal assessment of kidney function. Serum and urine metabolites were identi /uniFB01 ed using the same metabolomics platform and encompassed over 700 shared metabolites. However, there are several limitations of our study. Our analyses used covariates that were selfreported (hypertension medication, smoking). Because our study cohort included participants with an average baseline age of 76 years, average eGFR of above 60 ml/min per 1.73 m , as well as Black and White indi2 viduals only, our results may not be generalizable to younger populations, populations with higher prevalence of kidney disease, or other racial/ethnic groups. Because the liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy quanti -/uniFB01 -cation was relative, not absolute, we did not assess for associations between the fractional excretion of metabolites and kidney function or kidney function decline. Confounders may be measured incompletely and with error, and there may be additional confounders that were not included. For example, analyses of the effect of diet and fasting status on our /uniFB01 ndings were not conducted; previous studies in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension-Sodium trial have suggested that there may be differences in in /uniFB02 uential serum and urine biomarkers by dietary patterns. 52,53 The multimetabolite model of kidney function decline was designed to investigate the potential utility of including metabolites from both urine and serum; if optimal discrimination were the aim, performance might be further improved with a method, such as elastic net regression, that includes criteria for intermetabolite correlations. ARIC is a general population cohort of older participants, whereas GCKD consists of individuals diagnosed with CKD; the differences in the sample characteristics between the ARIC and GCKD cohorts may in /uniFB02 uence the validity of our replication.\n\nIn summary, we provide a comprehensive atlas of serum and urine metabolite associations with eGFR and albuminuria cross-sectionally and longitudinally in a large\n\n## Table 2.

Acute tubular ' injury (ATI) is observed across various types of kidney diseases and may signi /uniFB01 cantly contribute to progression to kidney failure. Non-invasive biomarkers of ATI may allow for early detection and drug development. Using the SomaScanproteomics platform on 434 patients with biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmedkidney disease, we here identify plasma biomarkers associated with ATI severity. We employ regional transcriptomics and proteomics, single-cell RNA sequencing, and pathway analysis to explore biomarker protein and gene expression and enriched biological pathways. Additionally, we examine ATI biomarker associations with acute kidney injury (AKI) in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) ( n =44), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study ( n =4610), and the COVID-19 Host Response and Clinical Outcomes (CHROME) study ( n =268). Our /uniFB01 ndings indicate 156 plasma proteins signi /uniFB01 cantly linked to ATI with osteopontin, macrophage mannose receptor 1, and tenascin C showing the strongest associations. Pathway analysis highlight immune regulation and organelle stress responses in ATI pathogenesis.\n\nThe tubules play a crucial role in optimal functioning of the kidneys, and their impairment is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality from conditions such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) culminating in kidney failure 1,2 . Tubular lesions on histopathology have been described across virtually all forms of chronic and acute kidney diseases. The kidney tubules comprise &gt; 60% of the kidneys cellular mass and have ' amongthehighest density of mitochondria and metabolic workloads of any cell type in the body 3,4 . The high energy requirements of the tubules result from ATP-consuming reabsorption of over 99% of /uniFB01 ltered sodium, glucose, and amino acids from the glomerular ultra /uniFB01 ltrate . Several studies suggest that kidney function decline is 3 more closely correlated with tubulointerstitial damage than glomerular injury 5 -7 .\n\nAcute tubular injury (ATI) describes a combination of pathologic /uniFB01 ndings, including tubular dilatation and epithelial /uniFB02 attening, tubular cell sloughing, and loss of nuclei, that re /uniFB02 ect the morphologic responses of the tubules to a diverse range of insults 8 10 -. ATI stands as a hallmark in the diagnosis of AKI but also manifests in the context of CKD 10 . Episodes of ATI and subsequent maladaptive repair can lead to the development and progression of CKD 2,11 . Therapies focusing on preventing or treating the consequences of ATI are lacking, but could\n\nA full list of af /uniFB01 liations appears at the end of the paper. *A list of authors and their af /uniFB01 liations appears at the end of the paper. e-mail: ischmidt@bu.edu\n\nplay key roles in preventing morbidity and mortality from various kidney diseases.\n\nSeveral studies have illustrated how large-scale proteomics approaches can identify important protein markers to prognosticate the risk of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with kidney disease 12 -18 . Few studies have used this approach to determine noninvasive correlates of kidney histopathology, which could potentially lead to the identi /uniFB01 cation of new therapeutic targets 19 .\n\nIn the present study, we used an unbiased proteomics assay to measure 6592 plasma proteins in the Boston Kidney Biopsy Cohort (BKBC), a cohort study of individuals with biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmed kidney disease and adjudicated semi-quantitative assessment of ATI. We /uniFB01 rst assessed associations of each protein biomarker with ATI severity and determined enriched pathways that may have biological relevance for ATI pathogenesis. We then investigated the expression of biomarker proteins and corresponding biomarker-genes in regional proteomics and transcriptomics as well as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from human kidney. Lastly, we explored associations between our /uniFB01 ndings and the development of AKI in three additional cohort studies with available proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling: the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, andacohortofcritically ill patients from an intensive care unit (COVID19 Host Response and Clinical Outcomes (CHROME)) study.\n\n## Results\n\nAs outlined in Fig. 1, we analyzed data from (i) individuals with biopsycon rmed ATI, (ii) individuals biopsied for AKI and healthy controls, /uniFB01 (iii) individuals from the general population at risk for developing AKI, and (iv) critically ill individuals at risk of severe AKI.\n\n## Identi /uniFB01 cation and characterization of plasma biomarkers of ATI\n\nBaseline characteristics of the BKBC study cohort are shown in Table 1. The mean age was 54\u00b1 16 years and 48% were women. The mean eGFR was 51 \u00b1 33 ml/min/1.73m 2 and the median proteinuria (IQR) was 1.4 (0.3, 3.9) g/g creatinine. The most common primary clinicopathologic diagnoses were glomerulopathies (40%), diabetic nephropathy (16%), advanced chronic changes (15%), vascular disease (12%), and tubulointerstitial disease (11%). Figure 2a shows the breakdown of ATI severity by clinicopathologic diagnosis: 53% of BKBC participants had no ATI, 30% had mild ATI, 13% had moderate ATI, and 4% had severe ATI.\n\nAssociations between plasma biomarkers and ATI severity are shown in Fig. 2b and Supplemental Data 1. After multivariable adjustment and correction for multiple testing, 156 unique proteins (170 aptamers; some proteins are measured by 2 or more aptamers) were associated with ATI. Among those, higher levels of 126 proteins and lower levels of 30 proteins were independently associated with ATI severity. Higher levels of the following plasma biomarkers were associated with greater ATI severity (top 5 /uniFB01 ndings in the order of level of signi /uniFB01 cance): osteopontin ( SPP1 ), macrophage mannose receptor 1 ( MRC-1 ), tenascin C ( TNC ), netrin-4 ( NTN4 ), and marginal zone B- and B1-cell-speci /uniFB01 c protein ( MZB1 ). The top /uniFB01 ve plasma proteins negatively associated with ATI severity were plasma serine protease inhibitor ( SERPINA5 ), cholinesterase ( BCHE ), neuropeptide S ( NPS ), kallistatin ( SERPINA4) and alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein ( AHSG ). Additional proteins associated with ATI with biological relevance in kidney disease include kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1; HACVR1 ), WAP four-disul /uniFB01 de core domainprotein2(HE4; WFDC2 ), growth/differentiation factor-15 ( GDF15 ), serum amyloid A-1 protein ( SAA1 ), and serum amyloid A-2 protein ( SAA2 ).\n\nOf the 156 ATI biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in the BKBC, 78 were analyzed within the KPMP regional proteomics dataset. Comparison with glomerular expression revealed elevated protein expression of several ATI biomarkers in the tubulointerstitium (Fig. 3a). When comparing regional protein expression between individuals with AKI and healthy controls, we observed protein expression of eight ATI biomarkers. All except one (apolipoprotein A-1; APOA1 ) showed protein expression in direction concordant with greater ATI severity as observed in Study 1 (BKBC). We observed protein expression of our top ATI biomarker /uniFB01 ndings, osteopontin ( SPP1 ), macrophage mannose receptor 1 ( MRC-1 ), and tenascin C ( TNC ), in the tubulointersitium of kidneys with AKI (Fig. 3b). Utilizing regional transcriptomics data, 42 of the 156 ATI biomarkers were found to be expressed in kidney tubules, 29 of which showed higher tubular compared to glomerular expression. We observed the highest tubular expression for WFDC2, GDF15 , and SPP1 when compared to glomerular expression (Fig. 3c). Detailed expression of these three markers in different kidney cell types is shown in Supplemental Fig. 1. We observed prominent expression of WFDC2, GDF15 , and SPP1 in cell clusters of the thick ascending limb. SPP1 was also strongly expressed in distal convoluted tubule cell clusters, while GDF15 and WFDC2 expression was prominent in clusters of connecting tubule cells.\n\nOf the 156 unique proteins linked to ATI, several play roles in the regulation of the immune system and intracellular pathways. We identi /uniFB01 ed seven key pathways (all p &lt;0.05) with relevance for ATI pathogenesis. Of these, the top-ranked pathways were: ' Intracellular Organelle Lumen, ' ' Endoplasmic Reticulum Lumen, and ' ' Immune System ' (Fig. 3d). Additional pathways that had immunoregulatory capacities included ' Interactions Between Lymphoid and NonLymphoid Cells ' and Neutrophil Degranulation. ' ' Proteins involved in these pathways included several cytokines, interleukins, members of the TNF receptor superfamily, and regulators of the complement cascade (Supplemental Data 2).\n\n## Difference of ATI biomarker levels in individuals with AKI and healthy controls\n\nIn the KPMP study, we analyzed plasma concentrations of the 156 ATI biomarkers comparing individuals with AKI to healthy subjects. After Bonferroni correction, 93 unique ATI biomarkers had signi /uniFB01 cantly different plasma levels in AKI vs. healthy plasma (Fig. 4a). Of those, 77 ATI biomarkers were elevated and 16 were lower in individuals with AKI. The direction of these changes in all 93 biomarkers was consistent with the observations made in the BKBC (Fig. 4d). We observed the largest differences comparing AKI to healthy plasma levels for kidney injury molecule-1 ( HACVR1 ), WAP four-disul /uniFB01 de core domain protein 2 ( WFDC2 ), and growth/differentiation factor-15 ( GDF-15 ).\n\n## Associations of ATI biomarkers with incident AKI\n\nThe baseline characteristics of ARIC participants are shown in Supplemental Data 3. Over a median of 6.8 years, 1084 ARIC participants developedAKI. Of the 156 unique proteins identi /uniFB01 edasATIbiomarkers in Study 1 (BKBC), 122 proteins were measured in ARIC. Of those, 35 were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with higher risks and 10 with lower risks of incident AKI after multivariable adjustment (Fig. 4b and Supplemental Data 4). The direction of these associations was found to be consistent (Fig. 4d): the same 35 proteins associated with elevated risks of AKI in ARIC were also linked to more severe ATI in the BKBC. Among those were osteopontin ( SPP1 ), tenascin C ( TNC ), as well as WAP fourdisul /uniFB01 de core domain protein 2 (HE4; WFDC2 ) and growth/differentiation factor-15 ( GDF-15 ). Similarly, the 10 proteins associated with lower risks of AKI in ARIC corresponded to less severe ATI in the BKBC (Fig. 4d).\n\n## Associations of ATI biomarkers with severe AKI\n\nAmong the 268 critically ill patients enrolled into the CHROME study, 34 developed severe AKI on day 7 after ICU admission (Supplemental Data5). Of the previously identi /uniFB01 edATIbiomarkers,38uniquemarkers were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with severe AKI after adjustment for age, sex, and COVID-19 status. Of those, 36 were associated with higher risks and 2 with lower risks of severe AKI (Fig. 4c, d, and Supplemental\n\nFig. 1 | Outline of studies, study participants, and primary outcomes.

These included osteopontin ( SPP1 ), tenascin C ( TNC ), and mannose-binding lectin 2 ( LMAN2 ), among others (Fig. 4d).\n\nAdditionally, we expanded our investigation to examine associations betweenour /uniFB01 ndingsandthedevelopmentorprognosisofAKIinthree distinct cohorts with available proteomic data.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis study provides an assessment of the plasma proteome in a cohort of individuals with biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmed ATI followed by further study of the proteomic results in external cohorts. We identi /uniFB01 ed biomarkers of ATI severity, assessed their tubular expression, and conducted pathway enrichment analyses that highlighted immune regulation and organelle stress responses as central mechanisms in ATI pathogenesis.\n\nPrevious proteomics research has mainly centered on analyzing the plasma proteome to assess risks of adverse clinical outcomes in individuals with kidney disease 18,20 -22 . Fewer studies have utilized proteomics to interrogate associations between circulating proteins and kidney histopathologic changes including ATI 19,23,24 . Kidney tubular injury can lead to a signi /uniFB01 cant decrease in kidney function. While it is commonlylinked to the clinical syndrome of AKI, it may also in /uniFB02 uence the onset and progression of CKD 25 . Someof the individual proteins we investigated have previously been identi /uniFB01 ed to be associated with ATI. Among those, plasma KIM-1 stands as the most extensively studied marker 12,26 . In prior studies using both ELISA and proximity extension assay (Olink platform) 27 , we observed consistent associations of\n\nTable 1 | Baseline characteristics of BKBC participants\n\n| Baseline characteristics            | n = 434         |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Clinical characteristics            |                 |\n| Age, years                          | 54.4 \u00b1 16.2     |\n| Female                              | 206 (47.5)      |\n| Race                                |                 |\n| White                               | 286 (66.2)      |\n| Black                               | 87 (20.1)       |\n| Other                               | 59 (13.7)       |\n| eGFR, ml/min/1.73m 2                | 50.8 \u00b1 33.2     |\n| Proteinuria, g/g creatinine         | 1.4 [0.3 - 3.9] |\n| Reason for biopsy *                 |                 |\n| Proteinuria                         | 231 (53.2)      |\n| Hematuria                           | 107 (24.7)      |\n| Nephrotic syndrome                  | 50 (11.5)       |\n| Nephritic syndrome                  | 8 (1.8)         |\n| Abnormal eGFR/Other                 | 300 (69.1)      |\n| Primary clinicopathologic diagnosis |                 |\n| Proliferative glomerulonephritis    | 111 (25.6)      |\n| Diabetic nephropathy                | 68 (15.7)       |\n| Non-proliferative glomerulopathy    | 62 (14.3)       |\n| Advanced chronic changes            | 63 (14.5)       |\n| Vascular disease                    | 52 (12.0)       |\n| Tubulointerstitial disease          | 48 (11.1)       |\n| Other                               | 30 (6.9)        |\n| Co-morbid conditions                |                 |\n| Hypertension                        | 256 (59.0)      |\n| Diabetes mellitus                   | 126 (29.0)      |\n| Systemic vasculitis                 | 11 (2.5)        |\n| Systemic Lupus Erythematosus        | 8 (1.8)         |\n| Hepatitis B                         | 4 (0.9)         |\n| Hepatitis C                         | 11 (2.5)        |\n| Malignancy                          | 64 (14.7)       |\n| HIV                                 | 4 (0.9)         |\n| Solid organ transplant (non-renal)  | 14 (3.2)        |\n| Medications                         |                 |\n| ACEi                                | 131 (30.2)      |\n| ARB                                 | 70 (16.1)       |\n| MRA                                 | 11 (2.5)        |\n| Calcium channel blockers            | 120 (27.6)      |\n| Beta-blockers                       | 156 (35.9)      |\n| Immunosuppression                   | 48 (11.1)       |\n| Corticosteroids                     | 68 (15.7)       |\n\nData presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, median [IQR] and count with frequencies (%) for binary and categorical variables.

Many other /uniFB01 ndings from the present study unveil new insights that may pave the foundation for future investigation.\n\nThe biomarker most strongly associated with more severe ATI was osteopontin (OPN; SPP1 ). OPN is a 44 kD glycoprotein predominantly secreted in bone and epithelial tissues. In the kidney, expression increases during injury 29,30 . Recent mechanistic studies have identi /uniFB01 ed circulating OPN derived from kidney tubule cells as a key mediator of AKI-induced acute lung injury 31 . Another study showed that plasma OPN levels in individuals recovering from AKI\n\nwere signi /uniFB01 cantly higher when compared to individuals with irreversible loss of kidney function after AKI 32 . In the setting of CKD, higher serum OPN levels were associated with worse kidney function and greater risk of kidney failure and death 33 . Our results provide further evidence for a strong association of OPN with tubular injury and suggest its potential as a speci /uniFB01 c tool to assess for the degree of ATI. Similarly, we found a consistent relationship between higher tenascin C (TNC; TNC ) levels, more severe ATI, and greater risk of AKI across cohorts. TNC, an extracellular matrix protein, is upregulated in the tubulointerstitium of CKD patients and has been shown to be involved in the transition from AKI to CKD by impairing tubular integrity through \u03b1 \u03b2 v 6 integrin signaling 34 .\n\nWe also observed strong associations between ATI severity and human epididymis protein-4 (HE4; WFDC2 ) and growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15; GDF-15 ). Both markers had higher levels in AKI, were associated with incident AKI, and were also among the top markers expressed in kidney tubules. HE4 is a serine protease inhibitor that has recently been shown to promote kidney /uniFB01 brosis by inhibiting the degradation of type I collagen 35 . Studies also found a positive correlation between higher HE4 levels and more severe kidney /uniFB01 brosis 36,37 . A prior investigation in diabetic kidney disease demonstrated that higher HE4 levels associated with increased risks of future kidney function decline 38 . Our study adds that HE4 may play an important role in the development of ATI. Additionally, the upregulation of this marker in both CKD (as shown in prior studies) and AKI underscores the interconnectedness between the two conditions and may provide additional evidence for the importance of kidney tubular injury in CKD progression 12,13,26,39 .\n\nGDF-15 is a member of the TGF\u03b2 superfamily and has recently been described as a marker of oxidative stress in mitochondrial diseases 40,41 . In the kidney, GDF-15 exhibits a range of functions that are variably antagonistic or complementary, contingent upon the cellular state and surrounding microenvironment 42 45 -. While some studies have found a potentially nephroprotective role for GDF-15 through the regulation of tubular Klotho expression 43 and downregulation of in /uniFB02 ammatory activities 45 48 -, elevated levels of circulating and urinary GDF-15 have been linked to increased risks of incident CKD, CKD progression, and death in individuals with kidney disease 44,45 , as well as higher risk of cardio-renal outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes 49 . After ischemia-reperfusion injury, GDF-15-de /uniFB01 cient mice had more severe ATI whereas recombinant GDF-15 attenuated kidney injury 50 . It is possible that in patients with kidney disease, GDF-15 levels may not have a pathogenic role but rather re /uniFB02 ect a compensatory response to acute or chronic injury that is present in the setting of oxidative stress. To our knowledge, this is the /uniFB01 rst study to investigate the association between biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmed ATI and GDF-15 in a large cohort of individuals with a diverse spectrum of kidney diseases. The observed association between higher GDF-15-levels and more severe ATI may yield further con rmation for the central /uniFB01 role of mitochondrial dysfunction in acute and chronic kidney disease where GDF-15 may act as an important mediator of mitochondrial stress responses 41 .\n\nAnother ATI marker associated with AKI across all cohort studies was LMAN2, which has been previously shown by Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses to be causally associated with kidney function. LMAN2, a protein also known as vesicular integral-membrane protein (VIP36), is implicated in transport processes and metabolic activities occurring on the apical surface of kidney epithelial cells 51 . Prior studies have demonstrated that LMAN2 correlates with albuminuria and is associated with kidney function decline 51,52 . A number of biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in this study, especially those with previously demonstrated signi /uniFB01 cant MR /uniFB01 ndings, merit additional evaluation for their therapeutic potential in a range of kidney diseases.\n\nWe found lower levels of seven plasma proteins to be associated with more severe ATI that were also signi /uniFB01 cantly lower in individuals\n\nFig. 2 | Acute tubular injury (ATI) scores and identi /uniFB01 cation of ATI biomarkers. a Distribution of semiquantitative severity scores for ATI by clinicopathologic diagnostic category in the Boston Kidney Biopsy Cohort (BKBC), Study 1. b Circulating plasma proteins associated with ATI severity in native kidney biopsy specimens.

Amongthosewasplasmakallikrein ( KLKB1 ), a serine protease inhibitor implicated in coagulation and blood pressure regulation 53 . Concordant with our observations, another investigation in type 1 diabetes revealed that plasma kallikrein activity decreased in more advanced stages of diabetic nephropathy, reaching its lowest levels in individuals undergoing dialysis 54 . Additionally, a recent genome-wide association study in the German CKD Study on OPN revealed a signi /uniFB01 cant association at a locus within KLKB1 , suggesting a potential link between OPN and the kallikrein-kinin system 55 . We also found that levels of complement C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 3 (C1QTNF3; C1QTNF3 ), a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family, were lower in individuals with AKI. This is congruent with a smaller investigation focused on diabetic patients, which reported lower serum levels of C1QTNF3 in those with type 2 diabetes when compared to healthy controls 56 . These /uniFB01 ndings are further supported by in vitro experiments demonstrating that C1QTNF3 mitigates TGF\u03b2 1-mediated kidney /uniFB01 brosis 57 and ameliorates lipid accumulation and necroin/uniFB02 ammation induced by high glucose concentrations in renal tubular cells 58 .\n\nWhile the functional signi /uniFB01 cance and potential prognostic value of these proteins remain to be fully investigated, many of them are involved in common biological pathways relevant to tubular injury such as regulation of immune and cellular stress responses. The leading pathways in our study related to cellular organelle stress including mitochondrial or endoplasmic reticulum damage. These pathways are critical in AKI onset and can also drive in /uniFB02 ammation and /uniFB01 brosis, key factors in the transition from AKI to CKD when stress is sustained 59 . In fact, several markers found in this study are markers involved in the pathogenesis of both AKI and CKD. Traditionally, ATI parameters have not been systematically assessed in biopsies obtained for CKD evaluation. It is possible, however, that the extent of ATI could serve as a valuable prognostic indicator for assessing the likelihood of transitioning from acute to chronic kidney injury, underscoring the potential bene /uniFB01 t of incorporating routine ATI assessment in CKD biopsies to enhance prognostic accuracy.\n\nSigni /uniFB01 cant strengths of our study include the large number of protein biomarkers included in the analyses. Detailed adjudicated histopathologic scores by two kidney pathologists allowed us to test associations between markers and the degree of ATI.

Our study has several limitations that warrant consideration as well. Given the intrinsic limitations of cross-sectional studies, which prevent the establishment of causality, additional experimental and clinical studies are needed to establish the causal role of the ATI biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in this study. While our study cohort underwent comprehensive phenotypic characterization, enabling extensive multivariable adjustment, we cannot exclude the potential in /uniFB02 uence of unmeasured confounding variables on our results. Our study delineates several proteins that warrant further investigation in animal models to elucidate their tissue-speci /uniFB01 c function within the kidney.\n\nIn conclusion, our proteomics study identi /uniFB01 ed over 150 proteins in the plasma of individuals with histologically con rmed tubular /uniFB01 injury, with subsequent interrogation of /uniFB01 ndings in separate cohort studies with plasma proteomics, regional proteomics, and single-cell transcriptomics.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Ethical compliance\n\nWehavecompliedwithallethical regulations related to this study. All studies included received approval from their respective institutional review boards (IRB) at each participating center which included the Mass General Brigham IRB (BKBC study), the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill IRB (ARIC Study), the Johns Hopkins University IRB (ARIC Study), the University of Minnesota IRB (ARIC Study), the University of Mississippi Medical Center IRB (ARIC Study), and the University of Washington IRB (KPMP and CHROME studies). Informed consent was obtained from participants of the BKBC, ARIC, and KPMP studies. In the CHROME study, participants were enrolled under an IRB-approved waiver of informed consent. All studies were conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n## Study populations\n\nThe BKBC is a prospective, observational cohort study of patients who underwent native kidney biopsy at three tertiary care hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts, including Brigham and Womens Hospital, ' Massachusetts General Hospital, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical\n\nFig. 3 | Expression of acute tubular injury (ATI) biomarkers in regional proteomics and transcriptomics data and pathway analysis. a ATI biomarkers with elevated protein expression comparing tubulointerstitial to glomerular levels in KPMPregionalproteomicsdata(AKI, CKD,HRT combined). b Protein expression of ATI biomarkers in the tubulointerstitium of individuals with AKI compared to healthy controls using Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test and Benjamini -Hochberg FDR to account for multiple comparisons.

The study includes adults \u2265 18 years of age who underwent a clinically indicated kidney biopsy between September 2006 and October 2018. Exclusion criteria were the inability to provide written consent, severe anemia, pregnancy, and enrollment in competing studies. Details of the study design have been previously described 60 . Patients provided blood samples on the day of kidney biopsy. For this study, we evaluated 434 participants with available plasma samples. The KPMP is a multicenter prospective cohort study of people with CKD or AKI who undergo a protocol kidney biopsy at study entry as part of the KPMP consortium (https://KPMP.org) 61 . For plasma proteomics analyses, we evaluated protein measurements of 44 participants (26 with AKI and 18 who provided healthy reference tissue). The ARIC study is a prospective cohort study of individuals recruited from four US communities 62 . Participants were enrolled between 1987 and 1989, with subsequent visits in 1990 -1992 (visit 2), 1993 -1995 (visit 3), 1996 1998 -(visit 4), 2011 -2013 (visit 5), 2016 2017 -(visit 6), and 2018 2019 (visit 7), visit -8 (2020), visit 9 (2021 -2022), and visit 10 (2023). In this study, we included 4,610 participants from visit 5 who had available plasma proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling and non-missing covariates at baseline. The CHROME study is a prospective cohort study of critically ill patients admitted to three hospitals af /uniFB01 liated with the University of Washington in Seattle, WA between March 2020 and May 2021. Details of the study design have been previously described 63 . In brief, patients were eligible if admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU) with signs or symptoms of acute respiratory illness. Exclusion criteria included being under 18 years of age, incarcerated, pregnant, or undergoing chronic maintenance hemodialysis. In this study, we included 268 individuals with available SOMAScan plasma proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling. All studies included in this manuscript received approval from their respective institutional review boards at each participating center.\n\n## Sample collection and proteomics assays\n\nProteomic pro /uniFB01 ling was performed on blood samples from the baseline visit of the BKBC, KPMP, and CHROME cohort, as well as visit 5 of the ARIC study. After collection, blood samples were aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0C. The SOMAscan assay was utilized for proteomic measurements 64 . This assay employs SOMAmers (selective singlestranded deoxyoligonucleotides) for protein binding and quanti /uniFB01 es proteins based on /uniFB02 uorescence intensity, indicative of relative protein concentrations. The ARIC and CHROME plasma samples were analyzed using the SOMAscan 5k platform (approximately 5000 proteins), while the BKBC and KPMP samples were assessed using the SOMAscan 7k platform (approximately 7000 proteins). In the BKBC, 6592 aptamers passed quality control metrics and were included in subsequent analyses; the mean coef /uniFB01 cient of variation (CV) on 8 blind duplicate pairs was 4.7%. In ARIC, KPMP, and the CHROME cohort, we evaluated only those proteins that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with ATI in the BKBC (156 unique proteins). For ARIC visit 5, the mean Bland Altman coef /uniFB01 cient of variation was 6.6% from 26 samples in blind triplicate. In KPMP, the mean CVs on 2 sets of 4 blind duplicates was 4.9%. For all studies, protein aptamers were log2-transformed and winsorized at mean\u00b15\u00d7SD and adaptive normalization was performed by maximum likelihood as previously described 64 .\n\n## Histopathologic outcome\n\nIn the BKBC, kidney biopsy specimens were adjudicated under light microscopy by two experienced kidney pathologists who provided semiquantitative scores of ATI scored from 0 to 3 re /uniFB02 ecting none, mild, moderate, and severe lesion severity. Methods to evaluate and score histopathologic lesion severity were previously described in detail 60 . The weighted kappa statistic (95% CI) from 26 randomly selected biopsies for repeat review months after the initial scoring for ATI was 0.67 (0.45 -0.89) 60 . All participants ' charts were reviewed alongside histopathologic evaluations to provide the /uniFB01 nal primary clinicopathologic diagnosis.\n\n## Outcome of acute kidney injury\n\nIn KPMP, patients eligible for percutaneous kidney biopsy for AKI must have elevated serum creatinine that is either sustained or accompanied by evidence of parenchymal injury. Detailed inclusion criteria for AKI biopsies were previously described in detail 61 . In ARIC, individuals included in this study were free of AKI at baseline and followed prospectively for incident AKI. Incident cases of AKI were identi /uniFB01 ed by International Classi /uniFB01 cation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modi /uniFB01 cation (ICD-9-CM) codes 584.5 to 584.9 and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modi cation (ICD-10-CM) codes N17.0 to N17.9 or a 50% increase from /uniFB01 outpatient serum creatinine during hospitalization. ICD codes were retrieved from hospital discharge billing and death certi /uniFB01 cates 65 . In the CHROME Cohort, the primary outcome was severe AKI within 7 days, de ned by either initiation of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) or a /uniFB01 doubling of serum creatinine from ICU admission 63 . In the ARIC and CHROME studies, blood samples were collected prior to the diagnosis of AKI or severe AKI, respectively.\n\n## Covariates\n\nIn the BKBC, detailed patient information was collected at the biopsy visit, including demographics, medical history, medication lists, and pertinent laboratory data and stored using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Partners Health Care. We obtained serum creatinine (SCr) from the electronic medical record (EMR) on the day of biopsy. In participants for whom this was unavailable, we measured SCr in available blood samples collected on the day of the biopsy. We obtained spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) from the date of kidney biopsy to 3monthsbeforebiopsyfromtheEMR.Ifbothwereavailable,theUACR wasused.Ifaparticipant did not have any of thesevalues, we measured urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio from urine collected on the day of the kidney biopsy. SCr and urine creatinine were measured using a Jaffebased method and urine albumin was measured by an immunoturbidometric method. The creatinine-based Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration 2021 equation was used to calculate the eGFR 66 . In ARIC, covariates included age, sex, self-reported race, systolic blood pressure (SBP), UACR, smoking status, diabetes (fasting glucose of \u2265 126 mg/dL or non-fasting glucose level of \u2265 200mg/dL, self-reported history of diabetes diagnosed by a physician, or use of medications for diabetes), hypertension (SBP \u2265 140 mm Hg and DBP \u2265 90mm Hg, or use of medication for high BP), and eGFR (calculated using the CKD-EPI 2021 equation, which takes both serum creatinine and cystatin C into account) 66 . Serum creatinine was measured using a Roche enzymatic method (visit 5) and serum cystatin C was measured using the Roche Cobas 6000 chemistry analyzer. The UACR was calculated using urine albumin and creatinine (measured using an immunoturbidometric method on the ProSpec nephelometric analyzer and the Roche enzymatic method, respectively). In CHROME, covariates including age, sex, and COVID-19 status were extracted from the EMR.\n\n## Regional proteomics\n\nWeinvestigated the expression of ATI biomarker proteins in regional tissue proteomics from KPMP kidney biopsy samples (https://atlas. kpmp.org/explorer/regionalpro; access date: April 20, 2024). Detailed protocols and dataset information are available at https:// www.kpmp.org/help-docs/technologies. In brief, kidney tissue was laser-microdissected to isolate glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartments. Following protein extraction from targeted tissue sections, proteins were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) for comprehensive identi /uniFB01 cation and quanti /uniFB01 cation. The study included tissue samples from 31 individuals (12 with AKI, 14 with CKD, and 5 healthy controls). We analyzed and compared the expression pro /uniFB01 les of ATI biomarkers between the tubulointerstitial and glomerular\n\ncompartments across all participants, and separately, evaluated differences in tubulointerstitial protein expression between healthy controls and those with AKI.\n\n## Kidney gene expression analysis\n\nTo map biomarker proteins to gene expression data, we investigated the expression of ATI biomarker-corresponding genes using regional transcriptomics and scRNA-seq data from KPMP (https://atlas.kpmp. org/explorer; access date: August 1, 2023). Tissue samples used for regional transcriptomics were drawn from living donor biopsy participants and used to compare expression (Fold Change) of our ATI biomarker genes of interest in the tubulointerstitium ( n =36; 9 healthy reference, 22 CKD, 5 AKI). Tissue samples analyzed using scRNA-seq were drawn from 47 participants (12 with AKI, 15 with CKD, and 20 healthy controls) and used to test for differential gene expression in kidney cell types. Details on these datasets have been described previously 67,68 .\n\n## Pathway analysis\n\nTo obtain basic functional information on biomarker proteins that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with ATI severity and to investigate potentially relevant biological pathways, we applied Pathway Enrichment Analysis using gene sets obtained from publicly available databases including Gene Ontology, KEGG, and Reactome 69,70 . We ranked proteins based on their strength of association with ATI. We then calculated normalized enrichment scores to identify pathways with signi /uniFB01 cant overrepresentation of ATI biomarkers. The Benjamini -Hochbergapproachwas employed to account for multiple testings and used to rank pathways based on the obtained p -value. Analyses were performed using the R package fgsea.\n\n## Statistical analysis\n\nWe summarized descriptive statistics as count with percentages for categorical variables and mean \u00b1 standard deviation or median with interquartile range for continuous variables. For skewed data distributions, we performed logarithmic transformation as appropriate. In the BKBC, multivariable linear regression models were used to assess associations of each plasma biomarker protein with ATI severity. In these models, the ATI severity score was used as the independent variable and each log2-transformed biomarker as the dependent variable. The adjusted model included the covariates age, race, sex, and eGFR. A prespeci /uniFB01 ed \u03b1 level of 7.58\u00d710 -6 set by Bonferroni correction (0.05/6592 proteins) was used to determine statistical signi /uniFB01 cance. In ARIC, we used Cox proportional hazards models to test associations between the ATI biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in the BKBC and the outcome of incident AKI. Models were adjusted for age, sex, selfreported race, SBP, smoking status, diabetes, hypertension UACR, and eGFR. In KPMP, we compared plasma levels of the ATI biomarkers in individuals with AKI and healthy controls using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). In the CHROME cohort, we explored associations between the ATI biomarkers and severe AKI within 7 days of ICU admission using logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and COVID-19 status. In KPMP, we used a Bonferroni-corrected signi /uniFB01 cance threshold of p &lt;3.21 \u00d7 10 -4 (0.05/156 proteins). In ARIC and CHROME, we adjusted this threshold to p &lt;4.1 \u00d7 10 -4 (0.05/122 proteins) and p &lt;3.79 \u00d7 10 -4 (0.05/132 proteins), respectively, re /uniFB02 ecting that only measurements of 122 (ARIC) and 132 (CHROME) of the 156 ATI biomarkerswereavailable. In other analyses, we considered a two-sided p -value &lt; 0.05 statistically signi /uniFB01 cant. Statistical analyses were performed using R Version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and STATA 18.0 (STATACorp, College Station, TX).\n\n## Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAccess to ARIC data follows NIH data sharing policies. Anonymized data can be obtained from the NHLBI Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center (https://biolincc.nhlbi. nih.gov/studies/aric/). Data access requests can also be submitted to the ARIC Publications Committee at aricpub@unc.edu. This process involves completing an ARIC manuscript proposal form, which can be found at the following link: https://aric.cscc.unc.edu/aric9/ publications/policies\\_forms\\_and\\_guidelines. The review and approval of data access requests usually take about one month. To share ARIC data, a data use agreement (DUA) must be signed with the ARIC coordinating center at the University of North Carolina. Data from the BKBC and the CHROME study are not publicly available due to data privacy laws. Access to these datasets can be provided upon request to the study PIs in line with the IRB guidelines at each study s ' institution and following approval of a DUA. Data sharing requests should be directed to the respective principal investigators Dr. Sushrut Waikar (BKBC; swaikar@bu.edu) and Dr. Pavan K. Bhatraju (CHROME; bhatraju@uw.edu). The data generated in this study are provided in the Supplementary Data /uniFB01 le. All data from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) are publicly available and can be accessed at https://www.kpmp.org/doi-collection and https://www. kpmp.org/available-data.\n\n## Code availability\n\nNonewsoftwarepackagesweredevelopedaspartofthisresearch.The analyses were conducted using standard regression models, implemented through readily available code in common statistical software platforms.

They are regulated via the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and have a heritable component. Using genetic information, we applied tissue-specific transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and plasma proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) to elucidate gene products related to thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels.\n\nResults: TWAS identified 297 and 113 transcripts associated with TSH and FT4 levels, respectively (25 shared), including transcripts not identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these traits, demonstrating the increased power of this approach. Testing for genetic colocalization revealed a shared genetic basis of 158 transcripts with TSH and 45 transcripts with FT4, including independent, FT4-associated genetic signals within the CAPZB locus that were differentially associated with CAPZB expression in different tissues. PWAS identified 18 and ten proteins associated with TSH and FT4, respectively (HEXIM1 and QSOX2 with both). Among these, the cognate genes of five TSH- and 7 FT4-associated proteins mapped outside significant GWAS loci. Colocalization was observed for five plasma proteins each with TSH and FT4. There were ten TSH and one FT4-related gene(s) significant in both TWAS and PWAS. Of these, ANXA5 expression and plasma annexin A5 levels were inversely associated with TSH (PWAS: P = 1.18 \u00d7 10 -13 , TWAS: P = 7.61 \u00d7 10 -12 (whole blood), P = 6.40 \u00d7 10 -13 (hypothalamus), P = 1.57 \u00d7 10 -15 (pituitary), P = 4.27 \u00d7 10 -15 (thyroid)), supported by colocalizations.\n\nConclusion : Our analyses revealed new thyroid function-associated genes and prioritized candidates in known GWAS loci, contributing to a better understanding of transcriptional regulation and protein levels relevant to thyroid function.\n\nKeywords: TWAS; PWAS; HPT axis; thyroid; hypothalamus; pituitary; TSH; FT4; colocalization; metabolism\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Introduction\n\nThyroid hormones (TH) affect cellular metabolism and thereby have vital functions for growth and metabolic homeostasis  (1).  Thyroid  function  is  governed  by  the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid  (HPT)  axis,  where  the thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus stimulates  the  release  of  thyrotropin  (TSH)  from  the anterior  pituitary  gland,  which  in  turn  results  in  the production of the main hormones of the thyroid gland, thyroxine (T4) and  triiodothyronine (T3). Feedback loops  at different levels of the HPT  axis  maintain stable  thyroid  function.  Many  of  the  important  genes involved  in  the  HPT  axis  have  been  uncovered  by  the study  of  monogenic  disorders  of  thyroid  function  (2, 3). However,  important  new  knowledge  remains  to be  uncovered,  as  evidenced  by  recent  GWAS  of  TSH and free T4 (FT4) levels that identified both a new TH transport  protein  encoded  by SLC17A4, as  well  as  a previously unknown TH-metabolizing enzyme encoded by AADAT (4).  Hypothesis-generating screens based on genetic  information  are  therefore  suitable  to  identify and  prioritize  previously  unknown  players  in  thyroid function. A dedicated analysis of all known TH-regulating genes  (5)  moreover  revealed  that  variants  in  these genes detected by GWAS only accounted for a small percentage of variation in thyroid function measures.  This  suggests  the  presence  of  undiscovered TH-regulating genes within the HPT axis. A recent largescale GWAS  meta-analysis  investigated  the  genetics of  thyroid  function  parameters  such  as  TSH,  FT4,  and T3-related  traits  (6).  The  current  study  builds  on  this GWAS  and  investigates  the  two  most  commonly  used thyroid function markers, TSH and FT4, which were also the focus of previous GWAS on thyroid function (4).\n\nAs a genome-wide screen, GWAS needs to be stringently corrected  for  multiple  tests,  which  can  result  in  the missing of true association signals. Moreover, significant GWAS  loci  often  contain  several  genes,  complicating the  prioritization  of  the  causal  gene.  Lastly,  GWAS  do not  provide  information  about  tissue-specific  effects, although most common genetic variants implicated by GWAS are intronic or intergenic and may differentially affect gene expression. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)  can  address  these  three  challenges by  studying  the  effect  of  genetically  predicted,  tissuespecific differential gene expression on a disease or trait of  interest  (7,  8).  TWAS  utilizes  genomic  information associated with a specific phenotype (GWAS) and weight matrices, which are computed using SNP-mRNA associations  (expression  quantitative  trait  loci,  eQTL) data for the relevant tissues from GTEx v8 postmortem tissue from donors, acquired from rapid autopsy and  organ  procurement  organizations  (9,  10).  These matrices quantify the relationship between  genetic variants  and  gene  expression  levels.  TWAS  thereby only  needs  to  correct  for  the  number  of  evaluated transcripts  across  tissues  and  directly  implicate  the investigated  gene  product  as  a  molecular  trait  that links genetic variation to the disease or trait of interest. Proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) represent an analogous approach by studying the effect of genetically predicted protein levels, currently focused on the plasma proteome (11). In addition to the advantages of TWAS, PWAS can identify trait correlations with plasma protein levels  that  are  mediated  through  mechanisms  other than their differential gene expression, such as the trans effects of TSH and FT4 on the circulating proteome. This analysis can give us insights into the HPT axis, and to the best of our knowledge, such analyses have not been applied to investigate other endocrine axes.\n\nThe aims of this study were, therefore, to use TWAS and PWAS  to  uncover  additional  thyroid  function-related genes  previously  unreported  in  GWAS,  to  prioritize potentially  causal  genes  in  TSH-  and  FT4-associated GWAS  loci,  to  contrast  different  tissues  of  the  HPT axis, and  to  characterize  the  identified  associations through  a  series  of  downstream  analyses.  Here,  we unravel  new  thyroid  function-related  genes,  reflecting the increased power of TWAS and PWAS analyses, while also  providing  valuable  insights  into  shared  genetic signals  underlying  transcript  and  protein  levels  and thyroid function levels. The  resulting prioritization of genes in GWAS loci contributes to a better understanding  of  the  genetic  architecture  underlying thyroid  hormone  regulation  and  implicated  numerous previously unreported relationships, such as those for ANXA5 transcript and protein levels.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\n\nGWAS  of  inverse  normal  transformed  values  of  free T4  levels  ( n =  119,120 from  37  cohorts)  revealed  85 independent  significant  SNPs  ( Pvalue  &lt;  5  \u00d710 -8 ),  and of  inverse  normal  transformed  TSH  levels  ( n =  271,040 from 46 cohorts) resulted in 259 independent significant SNPs. All study participants were of European ancestry. Individual study files were filtered by  MAF  &gt;  0.005  and  by  imputation  quality  &gt;  0.4  at the  marker  level.  For  the  meta-analysis,  SNPs  with minor  allele  frequency  (MAF)  &lt;  0.01  or  SNPs  present in &lt;75% of the sample size were excluded. GWAS were performed using genome assembly hg37. Variant identifiers (rsIDs) were annotated and genomic positions were converted to genome assembly GRCh38 (hg38) using the liftOver function from the rtracklayer R package (12).\n\n## Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)\n\nTWAS were performed following the FUSION workflow (13) based on weights from GTEx v8 tissues (European ancestry) considered relevant for thyroid function\n\n(brain hypothalamus,  pituitary, thyroid, and  whole blood). Gene expression weights and linkage disequilibrium (LD) reference data for persons of European  (EUR)  ancestry  from  1000  Genomes  Project (1000G) were downloaded from http://gusevlab.org/ projects/fusion/. Prediction models were based on elastic net modeling (13). Multiple testing was accounted for  by  a  Bonferroni  adjustment  for  the  number  of unique  transcripts  modeled  across  traits  and  tissues ( P -value &lt; 1.74 \u00d7 10 -6 =  0.05/28,768 transcripts). FT3 TWAS was  performed  for  a  selected  candidate  gene, ANXA5 . Overlap  with  significant  GWAS  loci  was  determined using GWAS variants with P -value &lt; 5 \u00d7 10 -8 in a 250 kb window around the TWAS gene.\n\n## Proteome-wide association studies (PWAS)\n\nPWAS  were  performed  based  on  an  adapted  version of  the  FUSION  workflow  ( 13)  using  plasma  protein weights from the European ancestry (EA) subpopulation of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study ( n =  7213)  (ARIC)  (11),  where  plasma  protein  levels  had been  measured  using  the  aptamer-based  Somascan technology (V.4.1 platform). Protein weights and LD reference files were downloaded from http:// nilanjanchatterjeelab.org/pwas/. Prediction models were based on elastic net modeling (13). Multiple testing was accounted for by a Bonferroni adjustment for the number  of  unique  aptamers  modeled  across  traits ( P -value  &lt;  3.78  \u00d7  10 -5 =  0.05  /  1322  aptamers).  Overlap with significant GWAS  loci was determined using GWAS  variants  with P -value  &lt;5  \u00d7  10 -8 in  a  250  kb window around the PWAS gene.\n\n## Conditionally independent colocalization analysis\n\nA  colocalization  analysis  of  independent  signals  was performed for each significant association. Colocalization of TWAS findings was performed using publicly available cis -eQTL  summary  statistics  from  GTEx  v8 (EUR). For PWAS, we used cis -protein quantitative trait loci  (pQTL) summary statistics from EA participants of the  ARIC  study  (11 ).  As  LD  reference  data,  we  used  a subset  of  15,000  genomically  British  participants  from the  UK  Biobank  (application  number  20272);  genomic positions were converted to genome assembly GRCh38 (hg38) using the liftOver function from the rtracklayer R  package  (12).  Plasma  proteins  and  gene  expression summary  statistics were extracted for every gene significant  by  TWAS  or  PWAS  with  a  250  kb  flanking region.  First,  independent  association  signals  within these  regions  were  identified  based  on  approximate conditional  analyses  via  the  GCTA  COJO-Slct  algorithm (14),  with default parameters ( P -value &lt; 5 \u00d7 10 -8 and a collinearity of 0.9). For each conditionally independent SNP,  conditional  summary  statistics  were  computed by  conditioning  on  all  other  independent  SNPs  in  the gene region using the GCTA COJO-Cond algorithm with default parameters (collinearity of 0.9) (14). Subsequently, approximate Bayes factors-based colocalization analyses were conducted for all pairwise combinations of independent  eQTL/pQTL  associations  against  the independent thyroid function GWAS associations (15)  using  an  adapted  version  of  the  Giambartolomei colocalization  method  as  implemented  in  the  'coloc. fast' function (https://github.com/tobyjohnson/gtx), with default  parameters  and  prior  definitions  ( 16).  Positive colocalizations were reported if the posterior probability of a shared causal variant (PPH4/p12) was \u22650.8.\n\n## GO, KEGG, and tissue enrichment analyses\n\nEnrichment  testing  of  the  significant  genes  identified by  TWAS for TSH (297 genes) and for FT4 (113 genes) was performed in different resources using gene ontology  (GO)  terms  (17),  Kyoto  encyclopedia  of  genes and  genomes  (KEGG)  pathways  (18),  Human  protein atlas  (HPA)  tissues  (19),  and  GTEx  v8  tissues  (9),  with highly  expressed  genes  in  each  tissue  defined  as  the top 10% most highly expressed genes. For more details on  the  processing  of  the  tissue  resources,  see  ref.  20. For  all  enrichment  analyses,  we  used  hypergeometric tests implemented  in  the  R  package  clusterProfiler version 4.0.5 (21), where we selected the overlap of the 15,422  genes  encoding  for  transcripts  analyzed  during TWAS  with the genes available in the respective resource as background genes. When testing for enrichment  in  GO  terms  and  KEGG  pathways,  after overlapping with the available genes in the respective resource,  the  gene  set  originating  from  TSH  contained 186 and 95 genes, the gene set originating from FT4  contained  76  and  38  genes,  and  the  number  of background  genes  was  reduced  to  9629  and  4339, respectively. When performing tissue-specific enrichment analyses, the gene set  assigned  to  a  tissue was  filtered  for  genes  encoding  transcripts  analyzed during  TWAS.  All  results  were  filtered  for  terms  with at least two genes. P -values were corrected for multiple testing  using  the  Benjamini-Hochberg  procedure  (22) separately in each of the different resources.\n\n## Investigation of significant genes for associations with human traits and diseases through PheWAS\n\nWe  performed  queries  of  phenome-wide  association results  using  the  AstraZeneca  PheWAS  Portal.  These results  are  based  on  the  UK  Biobank  whole-exome sequencing  data  (469,809  UK  Biobank  exomes)  and contain associations for phenotypes derived from electronic health records, questionnaire data, and continuous  traits  released  by  UK  Biobank  (23).  We limited our queries to gene-level associations to directly  link  them  with  genes  detected  in  our  TWAS (385  genes)  and  PWAS  (28  genes).  Gene-level  analyses\n\nwere  based  on  collapsing  analyses,  which  aggregated rare, putatively deleterious, qualifying variants in each gene  with  given  criteria,  including  ten  dominant  and one recessive model, and testing them against a given phenotype. P -values for binary traits associations were determined by Fisher's exact two-sided test, and P -values for quantitative traits were determined by linear regression corrected for age, sex, and their interaction (age \u00d7 sex). We considered all available binary endpoints ( n =  10,088) and quantitative endpoints ( n =  1927). The total number  of  unique  phenotypes  was n =  14,956. Therefore, we defined the following significance thresholds  for  our  queries: P -value  &lt;  1.19  \u00d7  10 -7 (0.05 /  (28  genes  \u00d7  14,956  phenotypes))  for  genes  implicated by PWAS, and P -value &lt; 8.68 \u00d7 10 -9 (0.05 / (385 genes \u00d7 14,956 phenotypes)) for those implicated by TWAS. The queries  were  further  filtered  to  retain  binary  traits with more than 100 cases and controls and continuous traits  with  more  than  30  observations.  Additionally, the number of cases or controls with qualifying variants  in binary  phenotypes  and  the  number  of participants  with  qualifying  variants  in  quantitative phenotypes had to exceed 3.\n\n## Results\n\n## TWAS reveal expressed genes related to thyroid hormone metabolism\n\nWe performed an HPT axis tissue-specific TWAS based  on  gene  expression  models  derived  from  GTEx project v8 data (Supplementary Table 1, see section on supplementary materials given at the end of this article) (9,  13)  and  GWAS  summary  statistics  of  TSH  and  FT4 derived  from  up  to  271,040  individuals  of  European ancestry across 46 predominantly  population-based cohorts  from  the  ThyroidOmics  Consortium  (Fig.  1). Each transcript was predicted using tissue-specific gene  expression  information,  which  allowed  for  the identification  of  genetic  variants  associated  with  gene expression levels in the relevant tissue (i.e. hypothalamus, pituitary,  thyroid,  and  whole  blood).  Across  tissues, TWAS  yielded  297  and  113  transcripts  significantly associated  with  TSH  and  FT4,  respectively  (Fig.  2).  A total of 25  transcripts  were  significantly  associated with both hormones. Of these, 20 transcripts exhibited inverse  associations,  meaning  that  their  correlation with TSH was opposite to that with FT4 (Supplementary Fig. 1A and Supplementary  Table 2). The thyroid gland yielded the highest number of significant findings across all studied tissues, accounting  for  76.8%  of significant findings from TWAS of TSH and 64.6% from TWAS  of  FT4  (Fig.  2,  Supplementary  Fig.  1B,  C  and Supplementary Table 2).\n\nFrom  the  297  unique  transcripts  associated  with  TSH in one or more tissues, 24 were not encoded by a gene mapping into a significant GWAS  locus. Likewise, the  genes  encoding  14  out  of  the  113  significant  FT4associated  transcripts  did  not  map  into  a  significant\n\nGWAS  locus  (Methods,  Supplementary  Table  2).  Thus, TWAS enabled a gain in power to detect novel thyroid function-associated signals due to the reduced multiple testing  burden  of  gene-based  analysis  as  opposed  to variant-based analysis.\n\nTo assess whether the implicated transcripts represented a molecular link between genetic variation and  TSH  or  FT4  levels  or  independent  associations  in the  same  genetic  region,  we  performed  conditional genetic colocalization analyses. Strong  evidence  for colocalization, i.e. the posterior probability of a shared underlying  causal  variant  (PPH4  &gt;  0.8;  Methods),  was identified  between  thyroid  function  (GWAS)  and  gene expression for 158 (TSH) and 45 (FT4) transcripts in at least  one  of  the  studied  tissues  (Fig.  2,  Supplementary Figs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and Supplementary Table 3). These colocalization  results  are  consistent  with  regions  in which regulatory  variants  affect  both  gene  expression and thyroid function, thereby enabling the prioritization of potentially causal genes in the GWAS loci.\n\nReassuringly,  significant  findings  from  TWAS  of  TSH and FT4 contained multiple positive controls, i.e., transcripts encoded by genes known to have important roles in thyroid hormone  regulation.  For  example, TPO , encoding  the  TH-synthesizing  enzyme  thyroid peroxidase, and PDE8B , encoding phosphodiesterase 8B that catalyzes cAMP hydrolysis, a key second messenger in  TSH  signaling,  were  associated  with  both  TSH  and FT4. Testing for colocalization confirmed  a  shared genetic signal underlying both higher thyroid TPO and PDE8B expression  and  higher  levels  of  TSH,  as  well as  lower  levels  of  FT4  (Supplementary  Fig.  10).  In  line with  known  physiology,  the  colocalization  of  TSH  and FT4 GWAS signals with gene expression was present in thyroid  tissue,  but  not  in  the  hypothalamus,  pituitary, or whole blood. Along the same lines, the colocalization of  transcript  levels  of  the  TSH  receptor  encoding  for the gene TSHR with  TSH was present solely in thyroid tissue. This finding is in line with the fact that the TSH receptor is  predominantly expressed (9) and exerts its main function on the thyroid, as the TWAS of FT4 did not show a significant association (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 3).\n\n## Tissue-specific differential CAPZB expression links independent genetic variants to altered TSH levels\n\nWe  observed  a  significant  association  for CAPZB in both  thyroid-specific  ( P -value = 2.02  \u00d7  10 -215 )  as  well  as pituitary-specific  ( P -value = 1.57  \u00d7  10 -15 )  TWAS  of  TSH (Fig. 3). CAPZB expression models were unavailable for hypothalamus-  and  whole  blood-specific  TWAS  due  to the lack of significant heritability of the eQTL in these datasets. Nevertheless, colocalization analyses between GWAS and  gene  expression  could  be  conducted  in  all HPT  tissues. These  analyses  revealed  colocalization between  genetically higher TSH  levels and higher levels of CAPZB expression in both thyroid (PPH4 = 0.99)\n\nFigure 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWorkflow of integrated transcriptome and proteome-wide association studies of thyroid hormones TSH and FT4.\n\nand  hypothalamus  (PPH4 = 0.89).  A  moderately  strong colocalization  signal  (PPH4 = 0.75)  between  genetically higher TSH levels and higher levels of CAPZB expression in the pituitary was also identified. Interestingly, independent  TSH-associated  genetic  variants  seemed to differentially modulate CAPZB expression in a tissuedependent  manner,  as  shown  in  Fig.  3A:  whereas  a TSH-associated  genetic  signal  upstream  of CAPZB also underlies differential CAPZB expression in the thyroid, another  independent  genetic  signal  centered  on  the gene  body  underlies  differential CAPZB expression  in hypothalamus.\n\nTo further substantiate the regulatory potential of these  variants,  we  analyzed  functional  genomics  data from  thyroid  tissue  generated  by  the  ENCODE  Project Consortium and found that rs10799824, the implicated variant  upstream  of CAPZB , overlapped  with  open chromatin  (ATAC-seq).  Notably,  this  position  was  not accessible in other tissues from the same tissue donor (ENCDO451RUA)  ( Fig. 3B ), supporting tissue-specific regulatory  function.  These  findings  were  confirmed in  thyroid  tissue  of  a  different  donor  (ENCDO793LXB) (Methods,  Supplementary  Fig.  11A).  We  looked  into PheWeb using 1400 EHR-derived broad phenome-\n\nA\n\nB\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Figure 2\n\nResults of tissue-specific TWAS analyses.

To investigate potential relationships between the genes identified through our TWAS approach and rare damaging  variants  associated with thyroid disease, we  investigated  the  individual  and  aggregated  effects of  rare,  putatively  damaging  genetic  variants  across the exome using whole-exome sequencing and clinical  outcome  data  from  the  UK  Biobank  (23),  as implemented in the AZ Portal (Methods).  Our  analysis revealed  significant  associations  for  the  TSH  receptor gene with endocrine  and  metabolic diseases, such as hypothyroidism.  We  identified  other  associations described  in  Supplementary  Fig.  12,  Supplementary Tables 4 and 5.\n\n## Pathway enrichment for TWAS findings\n\nWe  next  performed  overrepresentation  analyses  for genes  encoding  for  significantly  associated  transcripts from  TWAS  using  GO  and  KEGG  databases  to  identify enriched pathways (Methods). For TSH, enriched biological processes (GO) and metabolic pathways (KEGG) were related to growth factors, cAMPmediated  signaling,  and  cAMP  biosynthetic  process. Additionally,  genes  encoding  for  associated  transcripts were  overrepresented  in  morphine  addiction,  relaxin signaling pathway, dopaminergic synapse, and chemical carcinogenesis, among others (Supplementary Fig. 13A and Supplementary Table 6). For FT4, enriched molecular functions  and  biological  processes  (GO),  as  well  as metabolic pathways (KEGG), were related to metabolic processes,  thyroid  hormone  generation,  metabolism, and signaling, as well as chemical carcinogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 13B and Supplementary Table 6).\n\nOverrepresentation analyses to identify tissues in which  the  target  transcripts  were  highly  expressed (Methods)  revealed  thyroid  tissue  for  both  TSH  and FT4  and  additionally  minor  salivary  gland  for  TSH (Supplementary Table 7). These results provide evidence  that  transcripts  implicated  by  TWAS  of  TSH and  FT4  are  indeed  involved  in  molecular  pathways that  are  relevant  to  thyroid  function  and  molecular metabolism, including TSH and FT4 regulation.\n\n## PWAS reveal plasma proteins related to thyroid function\n\nPWAS revealed significant associations between genetically predicted levels of 18 plasma proteins\n\n(Methods)  with  TSH  and  10  with  FT4.  Two  proteins, protein HEXIM1 and Sulfhydryl oxidase 2 (QSOX2), were associated with both hormones (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig.  14A  and  Supplementary  Table  8).  Evidence  for  a shared  causal  variant  from  colocalization  testing  was observed  for  five  TSH-  and  five  FT4-related  proteins (Supplementary Table 9). Although HEXIM1 and Sulfhydryl  oxidase  2  were  not  among  the  proteins  for which  colocalization  was  observed,  dedicated  testing for colocalization with gene expression showed  a shared genetic signal underlying FT4 levels and QSOX2 expression  in  both  thyroid  and  pituitary  (PPH4 = 0.969 and 0.968, respectively).\n\nFrom all significant plasma proteins detected by PWAS  of  thyroid  function,  the  genes  encoding  for  5 and  7  proteins  did  not  map  into  a  significant  GWAS locus for TSH  and  FT4,  respectively  (see  Methods, Supplementary  Table  8).  Details  about  the  function  of these novel TH-related candidates are summarized in  Supplementary  Table  10  (TSH)  and  Supplementary Table 11 (FT4).\n\nThere  were  11  significant  shared  findings  between PWAS  and  TWAS:  10  with  TWAS  of  TSH,  including HEXIM1,  and  one  with  TWAS  of  FT4  (Supplementary Fig.  14B  and  C),  providing  evidence  for  a  molecular chain  connecting  genetic  variation,  gene  expression, and protein levels with thyroid function. In particular, ANXA5  (annexin  A5)  showed  colocalization  between TSH-associated genetic variants with both their plasma protein  and  their  gene  expression  levels  in  HPT  axis tissues (Supplementary Table 12).\n\n## Annexin A5 is inversely associated with TSH levels\n\nWe observed a significant inverse association between plasma levels of  annexin  A5  and  TSH  (PWAS P -value =  1.18 \u00d7 10 -13 ), and an inverse association between TSH and ANXA5 expression in the hypothalamus (TWAS P -value = 6.40 \u00d7 10 -13 ), pituitary (TWAS P -value = 1.57  \u00d7  10 -15 ),  thyroid  (TWAS P -value = 4.27  \u00d7  10 -15 ), and  whole  blood  (TWAS P -value = 7.61  \u00d7  10 -12 ).  These findings  were  supported  by  colocalization  testing:  we observed  colocalization  between  TSH  GWAS  and  both annexin A5 plasma protein levels and gene expression in  all  studied  tissues,  with  lower  TSH  levels  related to  higher  protein  and  expression  levels.  In  line  with these  findings,  colocalization  between  plasma  protein and  gene  expression  levels  was  also  observed  with  a positive correlation (Fig. 5A).\n\nAnnexin A5 (Anxa A5, annexin V) is a member of the Ca 2+ -dependent phospholipid-binding protein family of annexins,  functioning  as  a  membrane  stabilizer. Once the membrane is bound, the function of annexins can vary: some members of the annexin family act in vesicle  trafficking  or  membrane  organization  ( 1,  25). Furthermore,  annexins,  including  annexin  A5,  have been  described  to  function  as  a  Ca 2+   channel  under certain conditions (25 ).  The  latter  finding  is  of  interest\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Figure 4\n\nResults of plasma PWAS analyses.

Genes, exons, and the direction of transcription from the University of California at Santa Cruz genome browser are depicted. Plots were generated using Locus Zoom ( 44 ). (B) Simplified conceptual model of annexin A5 exhibiting calcium channel activity in thyroid cells. Calcium is required for the H202 formation in the iodination process in the presence of NADPH, O2, dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2), and thyroid peroxidase (TPO). Subsequently, iodination of tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin (TG) takes place to form, after coupling, the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. * indicates a significant association found in TWAS.

Image created with BioRender .com.\n\nbecause  calcium  is  required  in  the  iodination  process and H2O2 production to form thyroid hormones (1). Additionally, a previous  study  showed  that  on continuous  daily  administration  of  calcium  channel blockers, a gradual fall in levels of T3 and T4 with a rise in TSH levels was observed in rabbits (26). Our results showed a positive although non-significant association between  FT4  and  FT3  levels  and ANXA5 expression in  the  thyroid  (TWAS P -value = 1.27  \u00d7  10 -02 and  TWAS P -value = 1.02  \u00d7  10 -01 , respectively),  and  a  significant inverse  relation  between  thyroid ANXA5 expression levels and  TSH,  consistent with  stimulation of TH production  in  presence  of  annexin  A5  and  displaying the negative feedback loop (Fig. 5b).\n\n## Connecting PWAS discoveries to rare thyroid-related variants using PheWAS\n\nWe  investigated whether  rare putatively damaging variants in the cognate genes of plasma proteins identified in PWAS  showed  significant associations across  a  broad  range  of  clinical  traits  and  diseases. We identified potential connections between rare variants in the genes encoding for plasma protein levels whose  predicted  levels  were  significantly  associated with  thyroid  traits  in  PWAS  (Supplementary  Fig.  15, Supplementary  Tables 13 and 14). Gene-phenotype associations were observed for PSCK1 (from FT4 analyses) with higher fat mass, weight, and phenotypes related to body mass index. Additionally, plasma levels of peptide YY (PYY), a gut hormone involved in appetite regulation and obesity, were also associated with PSCK1 (27). PSCK1 encodes the prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), a serine endoprotease responsible for processing precursor proteins as pro-neuropeptides and  prohormones  (28).  Moreover, IHH identified  by PWAS of FT4, was associated with respiratory function and  height-related  phenotypes.  It  encodes  a  signaling molecule  associated  with  the  regulation  of  skeletal growth  and  development,  phenotypes  influenced  by thyroid  hormones.  Lastly, HGFAC , which  encodes  a protease  that  activates  the  hepatocyte  growth  factor hormone  revealed  in  the  FT4  PWAS,  was  associated with  sex  hormone-binding  globulin  (SHBG).  Thyroid hormones  (T3  and  T4)  were  shown  to  act  indirectly to  increase  SHBG  production  in  the  liver  (29),  and could thus be part of the pathway from HGFAC expression to SHBG levels.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis  systematic  study  of  the  relation  of  genetically predicted tissue-specific levels of gene expression and  the  plasma  proteome  with  the  most  commonly quantified thyroid function-related hormones, TSH and FT4,  has  several  principal  findings:  first,  we  identified thyroid function-associated transcripts and  proteins that are missed by conventional GWAS even at sample sizes well over 250,000 individuals. Secondly, the analyses can help prioritize genes in GWAS  loci, including previously identified loci. Thirdly, conditional colocalization analyses increased confidence in candidates  that  share  a  genetic  basis  with  TH  and provided information about tissue-specific and tissue-shared  effects  on  gene  expression.  Functional annotation of candidate variants implicated a potentially causal,  TSH-related  regulatory  variant  driving CAPZB expression  in  the thyroid. Fourthly, shared  genetic causes of transcript, protein, and TSH levels support the role of annexin A5 in TH regulation.\n\nIn  comparison  to  a  prior  TWAS  study  focusing  on TSH (30),  our  expanded  study  involved  a  much  larger underlying GWAS  and incorporated PWAS  of the plasma  proteome,  revealing  a  comprehensive  set  of transcripts and proteins associated with both TSH and FT4 levels. Our results confirmed most of the previously reported associations but also revealed new ones, thus contributing  to  a  broader  understanding  of  thyroid function and expanding current knowledge.\n\nWe specifically selected those tissues in which genes that influence thyroid status and disease are predominantly expressed. For TWAS, we, therefore, focused on tissues within the HPT axis (2), namely hypothalamic, pituitary, and thyroid tissue, to examine thyroid hormone production,  as  well  as  whole  blood,  which  gives  a systemic  view  and  can  capture  genetic  influences  on thyroid  function  that  might  be  reflected  in  peripheral tissues. Most  of  the  significant  transcripts  for  both TSH  and  FT4  were  found  in  the  thyroid,  which  may partially be  attributable  to  a  higher  availability  of transcript  models  for  thyroid  TWAS  due  to  a  larger eQTL sample size for the thyroid compared to the hypothalamus  and  pituitary  in  the  GTEx  data. Additionally, it should  be  noted  that the observed number of transcripts associated in the thyroid with  TSH  and  FT4  cannot  be  directly  compared  to hypothalamus  and  pituitary  tissue,  as  the  latter  two have  a  more  complex  cell  type  composition  and  play a  role  in  regulating  different  hormones  (31).  Namely, the  hypothalamus  has  a  complex  and  heterogeneous population of neurons and glial cells that regulate also other endocrine axes, which can affect thyroid-related gene  expression  (32).  Similarly,  the  pituitary  gland  is composed  of  different  hormone-producing  cell  types, with  TSH-secreting  thyrotropes  making  up  less  than 10% of the cells in the gland (33).\n\nOur  results  also  underline  the  link  between  thyroid hormones  and  trace  elements  by  identifying  not  only DIO1  and  DIO2  but  also  the  Se  transport  receptor LRP8 and the selenoprotein-specific translational regulator SECISBP2L. These findings are not only consistent  with  the  well-studied  role  of  iodine  but also selenium in thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism (34, 35). This points toward potential tissue-specific links, motivating further studies in experimental models.\n\n## CAPZB - different SNPs related to different tissues\n\nSix  independent  variants  in  the CAPZB locus  were identified  in  the  TSH  GWAS.  Of  these,  the  intronic SNPs  rs12042004  and  rs10799824  upstream  of CAPZB colocalize  with  gene  expression  in  the  hypothalamus and thyroid, respectively. In agreement with a potential regulatory  role  in  the  thyroid,  rs10799824  maps  into an open chromatin peak in the thyroid but not in other studied  tissues. CAPZB encodes  the  \u03b2-subunit  of  the capping  protein  involved  in  TSH-induced  engulfment of  the  colloid  by  extension  of  microvilli  and  filopodia, representing a key step for thyroglobulin mobilization and subsequent proteolysis of thyroid hormones, including T3 and T4, in the thyroid gland (36). Given the location of rs10799824 in the thyroidspecific  open  chromatin  peak,  it  could  affect  thyroidspecific  gene  expression  of CAPZB ,  e.g.  via  differential transcription  factor  binding,  leading  to  differences  in the  amount  of  produced  thyroid  hormones.  In  turn, these  differences  could  cause  changes  in  the  observed variation of TSH via the negative feedback mechanism by T3 and T4.\n\n## Annexin A5 function in thyroid hormone production\n\nWe described a conceptual model regarding the function of annexin A5 in thyroid hormone production based  on  the  inverse  association  of  TSH  levels  and ANXA5 expression in thyroid and other HPT-axis tissues. A reverse association, namely an effect of TSH levels  on  annexin  A5  levels,  has  also  been  described: previous literature in pigs and rats have shown that  annexin  A5  levels  are  dependent  on  the  cAMP pathway  in  thyroid  cells,  and  that  concentrations  and localization of annexin proteins are under TSH control via this similar pathway, resulting in higher expression of  annexins  mediated  by  TSH-induced  cAMP  (37,  38). Conversely, TSH-stimulated thyroid cells from rats were inversely associated with ANXA5 expression (39 ).  Our  study  also  showed  novel  findings  regarding ANXA5 expression  in  the  other  HPT-axis  tissues  and whole blood, as well as a relation of annexin A5 plasma levels  with  lower  TSH  levels  and  higher  FT4  and  FT3 levels. Recent  studies supporting  these associations of ANXA5 expression  and  protein  levels  on  TSH  levels in  thyroid-related  tissues  are  sparse.  However,  given the  tight  relation  between  the  different  tissues  in  the HPT-axis, it can be expected that the associations with TSH  (and  FT4)  are  present  also  in  hypothalamic  and pituitary tissue, but that these are driven by the effect of ANXA5 in the thyroid. The PWAS findings are consistent with  the  high  abundance  of  annexin  A5  in  plasma as a reflection of the general function of annexins.\n\n## PheWAS supports the relation of PCSK1 to FT4 levels\n\nPheWAS of thyroid function-associated genes identified by  PWAS  revealed  associations  between  rare  genetic variants in PCSK1 and several anthropometric phenotypes, as well as association with PYY, a hormone related to appetite regulation. Rare mutations in PCSK1 are  known  to  result  in  a  loss  of  the  encoded enzyme's  autocatalytic  cleavage  ability,  leading  to  a variable pleiotropic syndrome that can include obesity (40), malabsorption diarrhea, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, growth hormone  deficiency, altered thyroid and  adrenal  function, or impaired  glucose regulation  (28, 41). With  regard  to  altered  thyroid function,  patients  with PCSK1 mutations  demonstrate (mild) central hypothyroidism with low FT4 levels and normal  to  low  TSH  levels.  This  is  in  agreement  with our  PWAS  findings  that  show  a  significant  association between PCSK1 -encoded plasma protein levels and  FT4  levels,  denoting  that  both  rare  and  common variants  in  the  gene  relate  to  functions  of  the  thyroid (Supplementary Tables 8 and 11).\n\n## Study strengths and limitations\n\nTWAS  and  PWAS  are  important  approaches  for  genebased prioritization and for delivering potential mechanistic information by revealing a possible correlation between gene expression or protein levels  and  a  trait.  As  exemplified  in  this  study  on  TSH and  FT4,  which  are  key  players  in  the  HPT-axis,  this approach  could  also  be  of  interest  to  other  axes  in endocrinology.  Similarly,  combining  TWAS  and  PWAS with  available  GWAS  data  could  be  used  to  identify the molecular underpinnings of endocrine circuits. For instance,  cortisol,  a  key  player  in  the  hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis (42), or GWAS data of luteinizing hormone  and follicle-stimulating hormone  as part of  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal  axis  (43),  can provide  valuable  insights  into  the  underlying  genetic architecture. However, it is important to keep in mind that co-regulation of gene expression or protein levels, as well as predicted expression correlations and shared variants between expression weight models, can induce bias  and therefore lead to false positive signals (7). To mitigate  this  potential  bias,  we  included  a  conditional colocalization analysis step and confirmed that several candidate transcripts and proteins revealed by the TWAS and PWAS have a shared causal variant with TSH and FT4 levels. Additionally, the ability of TWAS and PWAS approaches  to  establish  directionality  in  the  observed associations  is  limited.  While  these  approaches  enable the identification of potential  causal  links  between genetically regulated transcript and protein levels with TSH and FT4 levels, it  does  not  ascertain  which  is  the cause  and  which  is  the  consequence.  Experimental\n\nvalidations are needed to unravel the temporal sequence of these associations accurately.\n\nTaking  into  account  the  importance  of  T3  in  thyroid function,  larger  GWAS  on  this  hormone  are  needed  to also  include  T3  as  an  outcome  in  powerful  PWAS  and TWAS  analyses.  Lastly,  the  underlying  GWAS  solely incorporated information from individuals of European descent. We used matching transcript and protein level models  derived  from  persons  of  European  ancestry, but our findings may therefore not be generalizable to other ancestries.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn  summary,  we  performed  well-powered  association studies of genetically inferred, tissue-specific transcripts as well as plasma  protein  levels  with  the  thyroid function parameters TSH and FT4 levels. We identified novel thyroid function-associated genes, including those outside significant GWAS  loci. Tissue-specific colocalization  analysis  revealed  associations  between a  thyroid-specific  regulatory  variant,  rs10799824,  and CAPZB levels. Furthermore, we developed a conceptual framework consistent with the calcium channel activity  of  annexin  A5  in  thyroid  cells,  revealed  by inverse,  colocalization-supported  associations  between ANXA5 transcript  and  protein  levels  with  TSH  levels. Our  findings contribute to a better understanding of transcriptional regulation and protein levels relevant  to  thyroid  hormone  regulation.  Finally,  our approach  can  be  used  as  a  conceptual  blueprint  for other endocrine axes.\n\n## Supplementary materials\n\nThis is linked to the online version of the paper at https://doi.org/10.1530/ ETJ-24-0067.\n\n## Declaration of interest\n\nMM is on the Editorial Board of European Thyroid Journal .

Proteins and metabolites were integrated using an unsupervised clustering method, and we assessed associations between clusters and CKD progression and kidney failure using Cox proportional hazards models. Analyses were adjusted for demographics and risk factors, including the eGFR and urine protein -creatinine ratio. Associations were identi /uniFB01 ed in a discovery sample (random two thirds, n 5 1139) and then evaluated in a replication sample (one third, n 5 569).\n\nResults We identi /uniFB01 ed 139 modules of correlated proteins and metabolites, which were represented by their principal components. Modules and principal component loadings were projected onto the replication sample, which demonstrated a consistent network structure. Two modules, representing a total of 236 proteins and 82 metabolites, were robustly associated with both CKD progression and kidney failure in both discovery and validation samples. Using gene set enrichment, several transmembrane-related terms were identi /uniFB01 ed as overrepresented in these modules. Transmembrane -ephrin receptor activity displayed the largest odds (odds ratio 5 13.2, P value 5 5.5 3 10 2 5 ). A module containing CRIM1 and NPNT expressed in podocytes demonstrated particularly strong associations with kidney failure ( P value 5 2.6 3 10 2 5 ).\n\nConclusions This study demonstrates that integration of the proteome and metabolome can identify functions of pathophysiologic importance in kidney disease.\n\nJASN 35: 923 -935, 2024. doi: https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.0000000000000343\n\nThis is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

This condition is associated with a heightened risk of various medical complications, including cardiovascular disease, bone and metabolic disorders, and frailty. 1 3 -A better understanding of the intricate relationship between the human proteome and metabolome in CKD may facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers for early-stage risk prediction and shed light on underlying pathways, potentially illuminating new targets for personalized treatment\n\nDue to the number of contributing authors, the affiliations are listed at the end of this article.\n\nCorrespondence: Dr. Pascal Schlosser, email: pascal.schlosser@uniklinik-freiburg.de\n\nReceived: December 6, 2023 Accepted: April 1, 2024 Published Online Ahead of Print: April 19, 2024\n\napproaches that enhance the management of CKD and kidney failure. 4\n\nThe human proteome and metabolome are interconnected, and these connections are vital for the proper functioning of the body. Together, they represent the summative effects of genes, environment, age, comorbidities, behaviors, and medications on overall health. 5,6 Proteins serve many biological roles, including as enzymes and molecular transporters. Metabolites, which represent intermediates or end-products of these protein-driven reactions, play a central role in energy generation and maintenance of a stable internal environment (homeostasis). Metabolites are also derived from external exposures such as diet or the gut microbiome. Both protein and metabolite concentrations are tightly regulated at various steps, including production, transport between different compartments, breakdown, and excretion. 7 10 -When examining comprehensive pro /uniFB01 les of circulating metabolites and proteins, it is evident that many of them are highly correlated. 11,12\n\nStudies in CKD to date have focused on proteins or metabolites separately. Several proteomic analyses have highlighted the association of the TNF signaling pathway with the progression of kidney disease in various cohorts, with particular emphasis on TNF receptor superfamily members 1a (TNFRSF1A) and TNFRSF1B. 13 15 -Furthermore, researchers identi /uniFB01 ed a signature of circulating proteins involved in in /uniFB02 ammation that was associated with the subsequent development of kidney failure. 16 In recent comprehensive screens, Grams et al. 17 and Dubin et al. 18 studied . 4500 proteins each across three cohorts and identi /uniFB01 ed dozens of distinct proteins associated with the risk of kidney function decline. Rhee et al. 19 identi /uniFB01 ed 16 metabolites that predicted incident CKD in the Framingham Heart Study, and Sekula et al. 20 identi /uniFB01 ed metabolomic markers of eGFR, incident CKD, and incident kidney failure. Wen et al. 21 in a metabolomic analysis highlighted potential markers of glomerular /uniFB01 ltration, carbamylation, and tubular function that were associated with CKD progression in three different cohorts. Similarly, Steinbrenner et al. 22 discovered eight metabolites whose concentrations in urine were found to be associated with kidney failure.\n\nTo better understand the early changes in disease processes, an integrated assessment of metabolomic and proteomic platforms together allows for an investigation of altered pathways rather than isolated molecular reactions. 11,23,24 An integrated approach is particularly relevant in the study of kidney disease because kidney function and its decline over time are related to many proteins and metabolites. The emerging associations from analyses of individual molecules have repeatedly implicated multiple molecules within the same pathways. 17,23,25 27 -In this study (see /uniFB02 ow chart in Supplemental Figure 1), we used a data-driven approach to identify pathways (referred to as modules) on the basis of circulating proteins and metabolites in the Chronic Renal Insuf /uniFB01 ciency Cohort (CRIC) study. 28 We /uniFB01 rst split our sample in a discovery and replication dataset to enable internal replication. We then used a dimension reduction technique called Netboost, which uses network analysis principles and has previously been shown to outperform other correlation-based approaches. 29 In this method, proteins and metabolites are organized into modules on the basis of their Spearman correlation, and the module information is then quanti /uniFB01 ed using principal component (PC) analysis. Hence, we were able to assess module-wise effects re /uniFB02 ecting the whole pathway rather than individual components and characterized these modules in terms of their relevance to kidney function decline and kidney failure.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Study Population\n\nThe purpose of the CRIC study was to examine the factors that contribute to the progression of CKD, cardiovascular disease, and overall mortality among individuals with CKD. 28 From 2003 to 2008, the CRIC study successfully recruited 3939 participants, aged 21 -74 years, with an eGFR between 20 and 70 ml/min per 1.73 m . 28 2 The study was conducted across seven clinical centers. Detailed information regarding the eligibility criteria and baseline characteristics of the cohort has been published. 28,30 In this analysis, we examined plasma samples from the year 1 visit of the CRIC study, which served as the baseline for our research. A random subsample of 1800 participants from the CRIC study was selected for metabolomic pro /uniFB01 ling; all year 1 participants with available samples underwent proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling. 31 For our study, we included individuals whose samples passed quality control assurance for both metabolomic and proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling ( N 5 1708). The /uniFB01 nal analytical cohort was split randomly into discovery (two thirds) and replication (one third) datasets.\n\n## Study Outcomes\n\nThe eGFR was calculated using the CRIC study equation, which uses both serum creatinine and cystatin C levels to estimate GFR measured by iothalamate. 32 The primary outcomes of interest in the study were time to kidney failure (de /uniFB01 ned as the need for KRT, i.e ., dialysis or transplant) and time to CKD progression (de /uniFB01 ned as the /uniFB01 rst occurrence of a decline in eGFR of $ 50% or incident kidney failure). The censoring date for follow-up was January 2019.\n\n## Proteomic Profiling\n\nWithin the CRIC study, a total of 5284 plasma protein aptamers were quanti /uniFB01 ed in the participants using the SomaScan platform v4, which uses a Slow Off-rate Modi/uniFB01 ed Aptamer-based capture array. The Adaptive Normalization by Maximum Likelihood technique used by SomaLogic was used to standardize the protein dataset, decreasing assay biases. To address the skewed distribution of raw values, the protein values were log2 transformed. In addition, any values beyond 5 SDs on the log2 scale were winsorized. Furthermore, certain aptamers were excluded from the analysis if the Bland -Altman coef /uniFB01 cient of variation exceeded 0.5 among 92 blind duplicate samples or if they were /uniFB02 agged by SomaLogic quality control. The /uniFB01 nal analysis focused exclusively on human proteins, resulting in a total of 4091 aptamers included in the study.\n\n## Metabolomic Profiling\n\nThe comprehensive procedures of the Broad Institute metabolomics methods, which encompass quality control aspects,\n\nhave been published. 31,33 In the year 1 visit plasma, a combination of three liquid chromatography -mass spectrometry injections was used to analyze metabolites. Different methods were used on the basis of the charge and polarity of the analytes. The raw metabolomics data were processed using TraceFinder (Thermo Fisher Scienti /uniFB01 c) and Progenesis QI (Nonlinear Dynamics), and metabolite peaks were identi /uniFB01 ed by comparing retention times and masses to reference mixtures and an internal database of over 600 compounds.\n\nIn the data preprocessing phase, several steps were taken to ensure the quality and suitability of the metabolite data. Samples that had more than 50% missing values across all metabolites were excluded. In addition, endogenous and unnamed metabolites that had more than 80% missing values were excluded from analysis. Imputation of missing values was performed using the minimum observed value (2.9% of metabolite values). Metabolite values were rescaled to have a median value of 1 and log2 transformed. Then, metabolites with a variance below 0.01 were removed from the analysis. Finally, to mitigate the in /uniFB02 uence of extreme values on subsequent analyses, any metabolite values that fell outside the range of 6 5 SDs from the mean were winsorized at those respective limits. The /uniFB01 nal dataset contained 630 metabolites.\n\n## Module Formation\n\nNetboost, an unsupervised three-step dimension reduction technique, was used in this study (Bioconductor R package, Netboost v2.10). 29 The process involves /uniFB01 ltering variable pairs to construct a sparse correlation-based network with strong edges. Variables are then hierarchically clustered into modules on the basis of this network, and moduleaggregated measures are quanti /uniFB01 ed using the robust PCs of each module. Netboost was used to characterize modules using combined proteomic and metabolomic data similar to a previous study on overall mortality. 24 The minimal module size was set to /uniFB01 ve, and distance measures were determined on the basis of Spearman coef /uniFB01 cients with a soft power coef /uniFB01 cient of three (default). To reduce dimensionality, highly correlated preface modules, de /uniFB01 ned as modules with a correlation of the /uniFB01 rst PCs . 0.9, were merged. Each module thus contains a unique set of proteins and metabolites. Modules were quanti /uniFB01 ed using three PCs or fewer if they already explained at least 50% of the module variance. The unsupervised Netboost procedure was /uniFB01 tted on the discovery dataset and module membership and PC loadings were transferred to the replication dataset.\n\n## Characterization of Modules and Association with Kidney Disease Progression\n\nTo characterize the identi /uniFB01 ed modules of proteins and metabolites, we regressed module PCs on various clinical traits. These traits included age, sex, eGFR, urine protein -creatinine ratio (UPCR), HDL, body mass index (BMI), serum albumin, diabetes status, and hypertension status. The UPCR was determined from a 24-hour urine collection and naturally log-transformed. Diabetes status was de /uniFB01 ned on the basis of self-reported use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications, fasting blood glucose levels $ 126 mg/dl, nonfasting blood glucose levels $ 200 mg/dl, or an HbA1c level $ 6.5%. Hypertension status was de /uniFB01 ned on the basis of self-reported antihypertensive medication use, systolic BP $ 140 mm Hg, or diastolic BP $ 90 mm Hg.\n\nSubsequently, we examined the associations between module PCs and the risk of kidney failure and CKD progression using Cox proportional hazards models. To account for potential confounders, the analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race, eGFR, ln(UPCR), HDL, serum albumin, BMI, diabetes status, and hypertension status. 34 -37 Effect sizes are reported in SD units on the basis of the discovery sample. Illustrating the bimodal distribution of a module PC, we strati /uniFB01 ed the module PC at the local minimum for the Kaplan -Meier graphs.\n\nFor each replicated module PC association, we performed the same analysis for the three proteins and three metabolites that were most strongly related to the module PCs on the basis of rank-normalized data (Spearman correlation coef /uniFB01 cient).\n\nHarrell s C-index, 38 ' as a measure of model performance, was assessed using the R package survival version 3.5 -5 39 for both clinical covariate -only models and the models incorporating both clinical covariates and module PCs. Only the independent replication set was used to assess the models ' performance and whether the module PCs improved Harrell s C-index. Replication analyses and tests ' for improvement were conducted in a one-sided manner. All other statistical tests were performed using two-sided approaches, and signi /uniFB01 cance levels were adjusted using Bonferroni correction to account for the number of module PCs tested.\n\n## Enrichment Analyses\n\nTo investigate pathways underlying the modules, we evaluated for enrichment of the metabolite super-pathways (amino acid, carbohydrate, cofactors and vitamins, lipid, nucleotide, organic acids and derivatives, organic nitrogen compounds, organoheterocyclic compounds, Xenobiotics) and subpathways using a one-tailed Fisher s exact test. In ' addition, we assessed the enrichment of proteins within the identi /uniFB01 ed module in terms of gene ontology terms. Only terms with at least three components that were measured were included in enrichment testing.\n\nEnrichment analyses were conducted using the clusterPro /uniFB01 ler R package v4.6.2. 40 To account for multiple testing, we used the Benjamini -Hochberg (BH) adjustment method, which controls the false discovery rate at a threshold of , 0.05. 41\n\n## Kidney Gene Expression Profiles\n\nTo localize gene expression within the kidney, we used the public domain data from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) as provided in the Kidney Tissue Atlas (https://atlas.kpmp.org/) 42 and extracted through the NephGen scExplorer (https://nephgen.imbi.uni-freiburg. de). We used the regional transcriptomics dataset ( N 5 36) to perform a Wilcoxon rank sum test for differences in regions (glomerulus, interstitium, thick ascending limb, collecting duct, proximal tubule, and distal convoluted tubule). The single-nucleus RNA sequencing data ( N 5 29) were used to test for differences in kidney cell subclasses. Experimental setup and cell type identi /uniFB01 cation were described by Lake et al. 42\n\nTable 1.

For each protein, we obtained all available clinical precedence for drugs targeting respective proteincoding gene. For each metabolite, we obtained all available evidence on the utilization of the respective molecule as a pharmaceutical agent.\n\n## Ethics Approval and Consent to Participate\n\nThe CRIC study obtained written informed consent from all participants and followed the ethical guidelines outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. In addition, it received approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Human samples collected as part of the KPMP consortium (https://KPMP.org) were obtained with informed consent and approved under a protocol by the KPMP single IRB of the University of Washington IRB (20190213).\n\n## Results\n\n## CRIC Study Population Characteristics\n\nThe discovery and replication samples displayed comparable distributions for all covariables included in the analysis (Table 1).\n\n## Integrated Omics Module Formation and Characterization\n\nThe 4091 proteins and 630 metabolites (Supplemental Table 1) were clustered into 139 nonoverlapping modules in the discovery data (Figure 1A). There were 154 proteins and 37 metabolites that did not cluster with sets of at least /uniFB01 ve molecules and remained unassigned. The mean module size was 32.6 proteins or metabolites; 69 modules consisted exclusively of proteins, 28 modules consisted exclusively of metabolites, and 42 modules were a combination of proteins and metabolites. There were 286 PCs used to represent the 139 modules (Methods).\n\nThe network structure was consistently recovered in the replication data (Figure 1B; Spearman correlation coef /uniFB01 cient 5 0.99, P value , 1.0 3 10 2 320 ). Modules consisting solely of metabolites or proteins displayed tighter correlation structures than mixed modules (replication sample PC1, mean Spearman correlations coef /uniFB01 cients: metabolites-only modules 5 0.81, protein-only modules 5 0.57, mixed modules 5 0.46), which aligned with the average degrees of these module types (mean degree across module types: metabolites only 5 12.0, protein only 5 26.0, mixed 5 60.3).\n\nModule PCs were related to clinical variables, demonstrating that many modules re /uniFB02 ect a speci /uniFB01 c phenotype (Supplemental Table 2). For example, 74% of the variance in the /uniFB01 rst PC of module 106 was explained by sex, which is consistent with many of the protein components being involved in sex hormone pathways ( e.g ., the luteinizing hormone and the follicle-stimulating hormone). The eGFR explained 78% of the variance of PC1 of module 15 (Figure 1C), which included creatinine and cystatin C among other proteins/metabolites that are known biomarkers of kidney /uniFB01 ltration (Supplemental Table 2), as well as more than 50% of an additional six module representations, all of which consisted of proteins and metabolites but one protein-only module. PC1 of module 15 was additionally the most strongly related module with UPCR (31% of variance explained). HDL was strongly related to module 122 -a cluster of plasmalogen metabolites (explained variance 30%). Serum albumin explained, at most, 14% of module representations.\n\n## Associations of Modules with Kidney Disease Progression\n\nThere were 537 kidney failure and 685 CKD progression events over an average follow-up of 9.5 (max. 15.5) and 7.4 (max. 15.5) years, respectively. There were 13 signi /uniFB01 cant module PC end point associations (four CKD progression; -nine kidney failure) in the discovery dataset (Table 2) in a comprehensively adjusted model ( P , 0.05/286; Methods; Supplemental Table 3) that were moved forward for replication. Twelve of the associations were direction consistent and four were validated in the replication dataset ( P , 0.05/#discovery associations, direction consistent) (Table 2): PC1 of module 15 was associated with CKD progression and kidney failure and PC2 of module 48 with CKD progression and kidney failure. All associations included adjustment for eGFR and UPCR among eight additional covariables (Methods).\n\n## Kidney Disease Progression Characterized by Transmembrane-Ephrin Receptor Activity and Amino Acid Module\n\nThe strongest association between a module and outcome was for module 15 PC1 and kidney failure (Table 2; kidney failure hazard ratio discovery 2.37 [95% con/uniFB01 dence interval, 1.69 to 3.33], replication 1.82 [95% con /uniFB01 dence interval, 1.19 to 2.79]). Module 15 included 82 metabolites and 214 proteins with a strong group\n\nFigure 1. Data-driven proteomic and metabolomic modules display a consistent network structure and relate to clinical characteristics. (A) Dendrogram of the 4091 proteins and 630 metabolites quantified in the CRIC study. In total, 139 modules (upper colored bar) were detected. Individual proteins and metabolites are depicted as the individual dendrogram leaves (lower colored bar: cyan 5 protein, red 5 metabolite), and height represents the pairwise dissimilarity of the topological overlap on the basis of the sparse correlation network. (B) Modules were detected in the discovery sample and transferred to the replication sample. The scatterplot shows the transferability of the module correlation, as expressed by the Spearman correlation coefficient of components with the PCs, from discovery to replication. The overall Spearman correlation coefficient is 0.99 ( P value , 1.0 3 10 2 320 ). The modules significantly associated with CKD progression and kidney failure are labeled (module 15: discovery 5 0.63, replication 5 0.64, module 48: discovery 5 0.48, replication 5 0.46). (C) The PC1 of module 15 displayed the strongest relation to eGFR and the strongest relation to UPCR of all module PCs.

PC1 summarized 42.7% of the variation in the 296 molecules. Central hub components of the module were NBL1, TNFRSF1A, ROR2, SELM, GM2A, and EFNA4\n\n(Spearman correlation with PC1 . 0.92). When screening the top three proteins and top three metabolites most strongly associated with module 15 PC1 (Supplemental Table 3), TNFRSF1A provided marginally stronger associations for kidney failure than the corresponding module 15\n\nTable 2.

(A) Loadings of module 15 components: The graph shows the contribution of each component in module 15 to PC1 and PC2. While the kidney disease-associated PC1 incorporates nine protective components, PC2 separates proteins and metabolites. Association of kidney failure (B) and progression (C) with module 15 PC1 distribution: The Kaplan-Meier graphs demonstrate the association between end points and the module PC stratified at the central local minimum in the PC1 distribution (minimum is agnostic of end point status; kidney failure log-rank P value 5 5.2 3 10 2 152 ; progression log-rank P value 5 6.2 3 10 2 148 ).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPC1 in the discovery sample ( P valueTNFRSF1A 5 2.2 3 10 2 7 , P valuem15pc1 5 5.9 3 10 2 7 ). In all other cases, the module PCs provided stronger associations (lower P values) than any of the individual molecules in discovery and replication (Supplemental Table 4).\n\nprogression (log-rank P value 5 6.2 3 10 2 148 , Figure 2C) was emphasized.\n\nNotably, only nine of 296 components translated into a protective PC1 effect for kidney failure, with all /uniFB01 ve protective proteins being transmembrane proteins (proteins: ATF6A, Alcadein a -1, ERBB1, and growth hormone receptor, C1GLC; metabolites: a 2 ketoisovalerate, myristoleate, homoarginine, and trimethylbenzene). PC2 separated the metabolomic and proteomic components of module 15 (Figure 2A). The distribution of PC1 was bimodal, and when stratifying samples by the local minimum (0.35; agnostic of case -control status), the association with kidney failure (log-rank P value 5 5.2 3 10 2 152 , Figure 2B) and\n\nThree super and subpathways were overrepresented among metabolites in module 15 (BH-adjusted P value , 0.05; Supplemental Table 5). For amino acids, carbohydrate, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and pyruvate metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and histidine metabolism, module 15 even included $ 50% of the annotated metabolites on the platform. Twelve gene ontology terms were overrepresented among proteins in module 15 (Supplemental Table 6), and transmembrane -ephrin receptor activity displayed the largest odds ratio (OR) among these (OR 5 13.2, BH P value 5 0.0047). The four ephrins in module 15 were among the core components of the disease-associated PC1, demonstrating strong correlations with PC1 (Supplemental Table 3;\n\nSpearman correlation coef /uniFB01 cient with PC1: EFNA4 5 0.92; EFNB2 5 0.91; EFNA5 5 0.91; EFNA2 5 0.89), with the /uniFB01 ve ephrin receptors also strongly related (Spearman correlation coef /uniFB01 cient with PC1: EPHB6 5 0.76; EPHA5 5 0.67; EPHB1 5 0.67; EPHB2 5 0.52; EPHA1 5 0.49).\n\n## Kidney Disease Progression Characterized by a PodocyteRelated Module\n\nModule 48 consisted of 22 proteins, and the second PC summarized 6.9% of the variation. Module 48 PC2 provided stronger statistical inference than any of the top three proteins (Supplemental Tables 3 and 4) in discovery or replication. It was furthermore signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with /uniFB01 ve patient characteristics: diabetes ( P value 5 6.78e-15), hypertension ( P value 5 2.62e-06), serum albumin ( P value 5 2.10e-18), UPCR ( P value 5 7.47e-33), and eGFR ( P value 5 2.53e-89). In kidney tissue, CRIM1 and NPNT emerged as the two encoding genes exhibiting the highest expression levels (Figure 3A). Notably, CRIM1 was identi /uniFB01 ed as the protein exhibiting the closest relationship to PC2 (Supplemental Table 3). Regional transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing show that both CRIM1 and NPNT are primarily expressed in the glomerulus ( CRIM1 : fold change 5 1.4, P value 5 7.4 3 10 2 6 ; NPNT : fold change 5 1.7, P value 5 1.3 3 10 2 3 ) and speci /uniFB01 cally in (degenerative) podocytes (Figure 3, B and C; CRIM1 : log fold change 5 2.9, P value 5 1.8 3 10 2 38 ; NPNT : log fold change 5 3.6, P value 5 1.1 3 10 2 73 ).\n\n## Risk Prediction Models for CKD Progression and Kidney Failure Improved by Podocyte-Related Module\n\nWe developed a model in the discovery dataset for each outcome consisting of the ten clinical covariates, and one model additionally adjusting for the replicated modules, and evaluated their predictive performance in the replication sample (Table 3). Discrimination of the model was signi /uniFB01 cantly better with the addition of each module for CKD progression and for module 48 PC2 for kidney failure. The highest C-statistic was achieved for the model incorporating both module PCs.\n\n## Drug Targets of Identified Components\n\nTo study the repurposing potential of the identi /uniFB01 ed pathways, we queried all components of modules 15 and 48 for ongoing and past clinical trials targeting the proteins or using the metabolites. Of the 209 unique proteins in module 15, 34 were annotated in the database (Supplemental Table 7). After exclusion of trials with status terminated or withdrawn, 160 drugs that are studied in the context of 2426 protein -drug disease combina--tions were identi /uniFB01 ed. This was driven by extensive research on some components (all with . 100 combinations: 702 EGFR, 363 VAGFA, 357 CD274, 214 MAP2K2, 147 IL2RB). Among the ephrins, an Ephrin-B2 inhibitor (CHEMBL4298079) is currently under phase 1 and 2 investigation for various cancers (bladder transitional cell carcinoma, urinary bladder carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, prostate cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, Kaposi sarcoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma). An ephrin receptor inhibitor (CHEMBL24828) was /uniFB01 rst approved as VANDETANIB in 2011 and has seven approved (all cancers) and 41 investigational indications. Of the 22 unique proteins in module 48, three were annotated (Supplemental Table 8). TFRC, TNFRSF10B, and TXN were targeted by nine unique drugs (one drug terminated in all trials). Among the 80 unique module 15 metabolites, 11 were annotated, of which seven were used in clinical trials, including two approved drugs -allopurinol and sorbitol (Supplemental Table 9).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis study aimed to explore the intricate relationship between metabolites and proteins and their association with kidney disease. Despite the importance of their myriad interactions -in their roles as substrates and enzymes, in allosteric interactions, and the assembly of protein complexes -few studies have simultaneously evaluated the proteome and metabolome. Recently, we identi /uniFB01 ed several mortality-associated modules of proteins and metabolites that related to diabetes/insulin secretion, cardiovascular disease, and kidney function. 24 In this study, we now integrated proteomic and metabolomic data into correlation-driven modules, projected them into a replication sample, investigated their association with kidney failure and CKD progression, and identi /uniFB01 ed ephrin- and podocyte-related modules that are associated with kidney disease.\n\nModule 15, the module displaying the strongest end point associations, was driven by many proteomic and metabolomic components, highlighting the utility of combining multiple sources of omics data. Enrichment analyses revealed transmembrane -ephrin receptor activity as a key driver of kidney disease progression and kidney failure. This /uniFB01 nding aligns with a previous study by Kiernan et al. 44 that implicated proteins in the ephrin superfamily with albuminuria, including a putatively causal association with EFNA4 -the most central module 15 PC1 ephrin component. Satake et al. 45 found several ephrin ligands and receptors as downstream targets of a comprehensive miRNA screen in patients with diabetic kidney disease with particularly robust independent effects for EPHA2 and EFNA4. Recently, a proteomic screen in the CRIC study with replication in ARIC also identi /uniFB01 ed the ephrin family and ephrin signaling among the top signals for a higher risk of CKD progression. 18 Early genetic studies investigated the relation of EFNB2 and kidney failure in 1071 Black patients, 46 and haplotype-based analysis reached nominal signi /uniFB01 cance ( P value 5 0.03) in the limited sample size. The ephrin-B2 receptor has been linked to kidney /uniFB01 brosis, 47 and a dedicated look-up of ephrins in our recent screen of the effects of proteins on kidney function 27 showed additional putatively causal associations for the Ephrin type A receptor 2 on albuminuria and eGFR ( P 5 6.6 3 10 2 4 , P 5 4.2 3 10 2 3 ) and for Ephrin type B receptor 1 on eGFR ( P 5 4.5 3 10 2 3 ; P , 0.05/11 ephrins). In this study, the association between the ephrin superfamily enriched module and kidney disease progression persisted even after adjusting for UPCR, indicating its independent predictive value. The analysis of drug targets revealed several ephrin-related inhibitors already under clinical investigation in the context of cancer.

In a comprehensive investigation across the proteome within the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, 15 aptamers exhibited a signi /uniFB01 cant association with eGFR decline by 50% or kidney failure. 17 Notably, 12 of the 15 aptamers were components of module 15, including NBL1, the neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1, and the most central component of this module (Spearman correlation of 0.94), which has also been independently implicated with risk of kidney failure in individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. 48 Module 15 was further enriched for members of the tryptophan pathway (enrichment OR 5 7.2; P value 5 1.8 3 10 2 3 ). Tryptophan has been highlighted in multiple previous studies using different study populations and metabolomic platforms. 21,22,49 -53 Furthermore, the link of protein and metabolite components of module 15 is supported by a recent study by Steiner et al. 54 They identi /uniFB01 ed a novel mutation of the TNFRSF1A gene, which encodes\n\nTable 3.

In the affected individuals, both the tryptophan metabolism ( P value 5 1.5 3 10 2 12 ) and histidine metabolism ( P value 5 8.9 3 10 2 6 ) were differentially regulated compared with healthy controls, coinciding with the two enriched amino acid subpathways in module 15. 54\n\nTo encompass secondary or tertiary biological functions of the data-driven pathways de /uniFB01 ning a module, we incorporated the second and third PCs for modules where the /uniFB01 rst PC explained , 50% of the variance. Indeed, module 48 PC2 showed a protective association with kidney failure and CKD progression. The central component protein, CRIM1, is a cell-surface, transmembrane protein that binds to a variety of growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor A. 55 Although the studied proteins were derived from circulating levels, the expression pro /uniFB01 les of proteins within module 48 in kidney tissue are interesting. The two most strongly expressed genes were CRIM1 and NPNT , both were speci /uniFB01 cally expressed extracellular matrix proteins in podocytes, 56 and the glomerular disease -relevant micro-RNA miR-378a-3p may target both NPNT and vascular endothelial growth factor A . 57 An quantitative UPCR study localized CRIM1 in the slit diaphragm of glomerular podocytes, 58 and immunolocalization and in situ hybridization studies in mouse kidneys demonstrated podocyte production of NPNT and deposition into the glomerular basement membrane. 59\n\nA Crim1 hypomorphic transgenic mouse developed glomerular cysts and severe glomerular vascular defects, followed by glomerular capillary defects, reduced GFR, and progressive interstitial /uniFB01 brosis. 60 Furthermore, a decrease in the NPNT expression level in zebra /uniFB01 sh induced podocyte injury. 57 A genomewide association study in Australian Aboriginal populations identi /uniFB01 ed a signi /uniFB01 cant association at CRIM1 for the albumin-to-creatinine ratio. 61,62 Taken together, these /uniFB01 ndings highlight a potential role for CRIM1 and NPNT in glomerular basement membrane and endothelial maintenance and integrity with relevance to disease progression.\n\nAnother notable /uniFB01 nding was the stability of the proteomic and metabolomic network structure. The modules identi /uniFB01 ed in the discovery set showed near-identical correlation structures in the replication data. Modules formed with metabolites alone had the strongest intranetwork correlations, suggesting strong master regulation and the potential utility of a clustering approach to the evaluation of metabolite -outcome associations. Interestingly, different types of modules (metabolite-only versus protein-only versus mixed proteins and metabolites) showed different in /uniFB02 uences of clinical characteristics. Among nine clinical characteristics, six (eGFR, UPCR, serum albumin, age, BMI, and hypertension) exerted the largest explained variance in relation to a mixed module, emphasizing the utility of the integrated analytical approach. For HDL, a speci /uniFB01 c plasmalogen metabolite module displayed the strongest characterization, and for sex and diabetes status, two protein-only modules were the top associations.\n\nThe study s major strengths included the use of network ' methods to integrate proteins and metabolites, the welldesigned CRIC cohort with long follow-up, and extensive metabolomics and proteomics panels. In addition, we used an internal replication design to validate our /uniFB01 ndings. The use of unsupervised rank-based network abstraction helped identify data-driven pathways and reduce the burden of multiple testing and presents a complementary view on kidney pathophysiology to analyses of individual molecules. However, the study also had some limitations. The used Netboost approach, like other correlation-based methods, does not establish causal relationships between variables. Module membership might be confounded by external in /uniFB02 uences, where the observed associations might be downstream of a common cause. While our analytic design is inherently associative and does not resolve causal directions, the stability of the network structure observed in the independent replication sample speaks to the robustness of the approach to generate physiological hypotheses at the pathway level that go beyond what is observed with a one-molecule-at-a-time approach. Because these conclusions are related to the comprehensive but costly combination of the SomaScan proteomics and Broad Institute metabolomics platforms, the study relied on internal replication, and the improvements in risk prediction were modest; our study is not intended to establish new clinical routines, but rather to provide insight into the pathophysiology of disease progression.\n\nIn conclusion, this study successfully demonstrated that the integration of the proteome and metabolome can identify molecules related to CKD progression. The clustering technique used sheds light on the combined effects of correlated proteins and metabolites on adverse health outcomes, complementing established risk factors. Ephrin transmembrane proteins and the podocyte-expressed CRIM1 and NPNT emerged as central components driving the observed associations and warrant further experimental and clinical investigation.\n\n## Disclosures\n\nDisclosure forms, as provided by each author, are available with the online version of the article at http://links.lww.com/ JSN/E629.\n\n## Funding\n\nFunding for the CRIC study was obtained under a cooperative agreement from National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (U01DK060990, U01DK060984, U01DK061022, U01DK061021, U01DK061028, U01DK060980, U01DK060963, U01DK060902, and U24DK060990).

It is a toolbox for both the central consortium analysis group and participating studies to generate homogeneous phenotypes, minimize unwanted variability from inconsistent methodologies, ensure high-quality association results, and implement time-efficient quality control workflows. The toolbox features a plug-in-based approach for customization of association testing.\n\nResults: The metaGWASmanager toolbox has been successfully deployed in both the CKDGen and MetalGWAS Initiative consortia across hundreds of participating studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in GWAS analysis optimization by automating routine tasks and ensuring the value and reliability of association results, thus, ultimately promoting scientific discovery. We provide a simulated data set with examples for script customization so that readers can reproduce the pipeline at their convenience.\n\nAvailability and implementation: GitHub: https://github.com/genepi-freiburg/metaGWASmanager\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nGenome-Wide Association  Studies  (GWAS)  aim  to  unravel genes implicated in health and disease and advance our understanding of physiology and pathology (Tam et al. 2019). In  GWAS,  obtaining  meaningful  results  involves  increasing sample sizes through meta-analysis, as exemplified by the saturation of height GWAS signals with multi-million individuals (Yengo et al. 2022). Partnership within consortia, as seen in the collaborative efforts of CKDGen  over  a  decade (Kottgen and Pattaro 2020), is critical to achieving these sam-\u20ac ple sizes. Consortia typically establish a centralized analysis group, and study-specific analysts follow a predefined analysis plan. To ensure reliable results, maintaining high-quality, standardized  phenotypic  data  and  genotypes  across  studies and quality control on the contributing study summary statistics are imperative.\n\nTherefore, we aim to offer a versatile framework that can be universally applied to accomplish complex tasks with different tools  for  phenotype  generation  and  statistical  analyses.  This intends to minimize between-studies heterogeneity originating from  the  use  of  inconsistent  methodologies,  disparate  data preparation, or divergent tools for statistical tests, and to save time by automating routine tasks both for the central Consortium Analysts (CA) group and the Study Analysts (SA).\n\nIn  this  article,  we  introduce  a  comprehensive  toolbox leveraging  existing  software  packages  and  streamlining  the entire consortia workflow. This includes harmonization and quality control of phenotypes, GWAS, quality control reports of GWAS (in the form of test statistics and plots) and metaanalysis, providing an integrated solution for study sites and central analysis teams (Fig. 1).\n\n## 2 Methods and workflow\n\nFor the presented tools, we build on R, Bash and Python as a foundation  universally  available  across  study  sites.  While CAs benefit  from  some  familiarity  with  these  languages  to customize the toolbox to the consortium, SAs do not need specific coding skills. To fulfill the unique needs of each consortium, we adopted a plug-in concept, allowing for the flexible  customization  of  the  analysis  pipeline  with  respect  to phenotype preparation and used association software tools.\n\nOur toolbox addresses two groups of users. First, the CA group  is  responsible  for  the  analysis  plan,  pre-  and  post-\n\n2\n\nFigure 1. Workflow.

Shaded and white sections indicate tasks to be carried out by CAs and SAs, respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGWAS  quality  control  design,  meta-analysis,  and  other downstream analyses. CAs do not have access to individuallevel participant data. Second, the SA performs the phenotype preparation and association analyses at the study level and upload their results to the consortium server.\n\nThe  workflow  comprises  five  phases  and  is  presented  in Fig. 1. In the first phase, starting with an analysis plan, the CAs customize the metaGWASmanager scripts according to the  specific  requirements  of  the  consortium.  The  CAs  can easily  adopt  the consortium-specifics.R plug-in  file  to  meet diverse requirements aligned with the accompanying analysis plan. This enables customization of the entire analysis process, ranging from SA phenotype preparation over the actual GWAS to the centralized summary statistics quality control and  meta-analysis  by  the  CA  group.  MetaGWASmanager currently implements plink 2.0 (Chang et al. 2015) and regenie  (Mbatchou et  al. 2021)  association  softwares  and  can easily  be  customized for other tools. The analysis plan and the  customized  toolbox  are  distributed  to  the  participating SAs.\n\nIn the second phase, the SAs prepare a study-specific phenotype  file,  using  a  programming  language  of  their  choice, and run the toolbox to check and summarize it. The script conducts  a  thorough  examination  of  the  input  file,  issuing warnings and detecting errors to ensure high-quality phenotypic data and avoid common pitfalls like wrong unit conversions or variations in assay  methods.  Furthermore,  the pipeline performs necessary trait transformations, stratification, and calculations, standardizing the phenotypic data for consistency. SAs then upload the generated phenotype summary statistics (not containing individual-level data) and diagnostic  plots  (Supplementary  Data),  including  descriptive graphs of trait-specific variables to the CAs.\n\nIn the third phase, CAs inspect phenotype distributions, detect outliers, and validate across studies (Fig. 1). After phenotype approval, in phase 4, studies proceed with the preparation of their genotypic data in a compatible format, with  the  help  of  provided  scripts,  and  execute  the  GWAS. The  toolbox  provides  job  scripts  and  includes  GWAS  tool command  line  options  to  ensure  best  practice  analysis. Results are packaged in a standardized way to facilitate CA group analyses.  These  include  marker  association  statistics, phenotype summaries of the phenotypes actually used for association after sample exclusions, and diagnostic log files.\n\nIn phase 5, to maintain the highest possible data quality, the CAs employ code to properly format and verify GWAS statistics.  GWAS  files  are  examined  using  the  GWASinspector  R package (Ani et al. 2021). A wide variety of diagnostic reports are generated to facilitate the check for several potential issues, including  discrepancies  in  genomic  builds,  allele  switches  and swaps, missing data, file and number formatting issues, unaccounted inflation, and incorrect transformations. The CA group communicates  any  identified  issue  back  to  the  respective  SA for resolution.\n\nLastly, our pipeline facilitates progress tracking and reporting by generating tables and plots that allow for efficient  monitoring  of  the  consortium's  progress,  such  as  ongoing  GWAS  status,  studies  awaiting  analysis,  and  current sample sizes. These tracking mechanisms are crucial for effective coordination and management of the consortium effort.  Once  data  collection  and  QC  is  complete,  the  actual GWAS  meta-analysis  is  conducted  using  METAL  (Willer et al. 2010).\n\n## 3 Applications in the CKDGen and metals consortia\n\nThe presented toolbox has been developed in the context of the  CKDGen  consortium  (Teumer et  al. 2019,  Tin et  al. 2019, 2021, Wuttke et al. 2019, Schlosser et al. 2021) and has  recently  been  successfully  applied  in  an  ongoing  largescale GWAS meta-analyses with over 130 participating studies of &gt; 2 million individuals with 18 endpoints and a total of &gt; 1,800 unique GWAS. We show exemplary phenotype and cleaning diagnostic plots and reports along with comprehensive documentation in the Supplementary data.\n\nTo  prove  the  transferability  of  the  workflow,  we  implemented the same tools with the recently established MetalGWAS Initiative studying &gt; 40 phenotypes in \ufffd 10 studies (https://biodama.isciii.es/metal-gwas/).\n\nFurthermore,  we  provide  sample  scripts  to  run  the  complete process using simulated data.\n\n## 4 Conclusion\n\nThe metaGWASmanager aids to identify an increased number of associated variants by reducing between-study heterogeneity from inconsistent methodologies in phenotype preparation  and  divergent  tools  in  association  analyses.  By establishing  output  file  consistency,  it  supports  the  metaanalyses  processes.  Its  technical  foundation  in  R,  Bash  and Python, along with the flexible plug-in concept and comprehensive documentation, facilitates quick implementations in a  wide  range  of  settings.  The  provided  simulated  data  set with examples of script customization will allow readers to easily reproduce and familiarize themselves with the pipeline.\n\nThe metaGWASmanager tool significantly streamlines analytical  workflows  by  automating  routine  tasks,  ultimately saving  valuable  time  of  the  GWAS  consortium  team  and making the scientific output more robust, thus facilitating biological discovery.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank the members of the CKDGen core analyst group for their extended feedback on the different versions of the workflow over the past years and the GCKD study for the use of aggregate data to illustrate the application.\n\n## Supplementary data\n\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.\n\n## Conflict of interest\n\nNone declared.\n\n## Funding\n\nThe  work  of  P.S.  was  supported  by  the  German  Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) ProjectID  523737608  (SCHL  2292/2-1),  530592017  (SCHL  2292/ 3-1) and Germany's Excellence Strategy (CIBSS-EXC-2189Project-ID 390939984).

Using rare variant aggregation testing based on whole-exome sequencing data to detect genes associated with levels of 1,294 plasma and 1,396 urine metabolites, we discovered 235 genemetabolite associations, many previously unreported. Complementary approaches (genetic, computational (in silico gene knockouts in whole-body models of human metabolism) and one experimental proof of principle) provided orthogonal evidence that studies of rare, damaging variants in the heterozygous state permit inferences concordant with those from inborn errors of metabolism. Allelic series of functional variants in transporters responsible for transcellular sulfate reabsorption (SLC13A1, SLC26A1) exhibited graded effects on plasma sulfate and human height and pinpointed alleles associated with increased odds of diverse musculoskeletal traits and diseases in the population. This integrative approach can identify new players in incompletely characterized human metabolic reactions and reveal metabolic readouts informative of human traits and diseases.\n\nA complex interplay of thousands of enzymes and transport proteins is involved in maintaining physiological levels of intermediates and end products of metabolism. Disturbances of their function can result in severe diseases, such as those caused by inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs), or predispose to common metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes or gout. While the study of rare, early-onset, autosomal recessive IEMs has uncovered many metabolite-related genes, such studies are limited by the very low number of persons homozygous for the causative variants. Conversely, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in large populations have revealed thousands of common genetic variants associated with altered metabolite levels 1-13 , but these variants' functional effects are often unknown, and their modest effect sizes limit their direct clinical impact.\n\nGene-based aggregation testing of rare, putatively damaging variants in population studies can address this challenge. Previously, such studies have focused almost exclusively on the circulating\n\nA full list of affiliations appears at the end of the paper. e-mail: johannes.hertel@med.uni-greifswald.de; anna.koettgen@uniklinik-freiburg.de\n\nFig. 1 | Overview of the study design.

We have shown recently that GWASs of paired plasma and urine metabolomes do not only reveal many more associations but also enable specific insights into renal metabolite handling . We 2 therefore aimed to perform gene-based testing of the aggregate effect of rare variants on the levels of 1,294 plasma and 1,396 urine metabolites quantified from 4,737 participants in the German Chronic Kidney Disease (GCKD) study with whole-exome sequencing (WES) data to identify metabolism-related genes and to understand whether the underlying rare, almost exclusively heterozygous variants permit inferences complementary to the ones obtained from the study of IEMs.\n\nlinkage permits the systematic study of the aggregated and individual effects of rare, damaging, metabolite-associated variants on a wide variety of traits and diseases.\n\nPatients with IEMs typically show severe symptoms that originate from accumulation or depletion of metabolites, while heterozygous carriers of the causative variants often show milder changes of the same or related metabolic phenotypes 21 . We hypothesized that sex-specific analysis of metabolite-associated, X chromosomal genes as well as knowledge-based, computational modeling based on sex-specific organ-resolved whole-body models (WBMs 22 ; Methods) of human metabolism can inform on whether heterozygous damaging variants capture the metabolic effects of their unobserved homozygous counterparts. WBMs enable the investigation of homozygous gene defects through deterministic in silico knockout modeling. The resulting virtual IEMs reflect observed IEMs 22-25 . We further hypothesized that metabolite-associated rare variants identified in the GCKD study would show associations with related human traits and diseases in very large population studies and that the genetic effects would be proportional to their effects on metabolite levels if the implicated metabolites are molecular readouts of disease-relevant processes. The large UK Biobank (UKB) with WES data and extensive health record\n\nHere, we set out to perform gene-based rare variant aggregation testing to discover genes associated with metabolite levels and to characterize their genetic architecture with respect to the identified variants and across plasma and urine. We validate identified genes and variants and the range of their effects through complementary genetic approaches, with a new computational method based on WBMs 22,23 and through proof-of-principle experimental studies, and identify traits and diseases for which these metabolites represent molecular readouts.\n\n## Results\n\nAs summarized in Fig. 1, rare, putatively damaging variants were identified in 16,525 genes based on WES data from 4,737 GCKD study participants (mean age of 60 years, 40% women; Supplementary Table 1). Metabolites were determined by nontargeted mass spectrometry and covered a wide variety of superpathways (Metabolon HD4 platform; Supplementary Table 2). Exome-wide burden tests for the association between each gene and the levels of each of 1,294 plasma and 1,396 urine metabolites (781 overlapping) were carried out using two complementary 'masks' that differed in the selection of qualifying variants (QVs; Methods) for gene-based aggregation. While the 'LoF\\_mis' mask contained a median of eight QVs per gene predicted to be either high-confidence loss-of-function (LoF) variants or deleterious missense or in-frame nonsynonymous variants, the 'HI\\_mis' mask contained a median of 16 QVs per gene predicted\n\nas high-impact consequence (transcript ablation or amplification, splice acceptor or donor, stop-gain, frameshift, start or stop lost) or as deleterious missense variants using additional prediction scores (Methods). Both masks assume a LoF mechanism but account for different genetic architectures.\n\n## Discovery of 192 significant gene-metabolite associations\n\nWe identified 192 significant gene-metabolite pairs across both plasma ( P value &lt; 5.04 \u00d7 10 -9 ) and urine ( P value &lt; 4.46 \u00d7 10 -9 ), where 43 associations were detected in both (192 + 43 associations overall; Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 3). These involved 73 unique genes and 179 metabolites, with a comparable number of genes and metabolites identified in plasma and urine. There were 22 and 17 genes with significant associations exclusively in plasma and in urine, respectively. While the majority of associations was detected with both masks, the more inclusive 'HI\\_mis' mask yielded more mask-specific associations than the 'LoF\\_mis' mask (Fig. 2b). Amino acids and lipids were the dominating pathways among the associated metabolites (Supplementary Fig. 1). The higher proportion of implicated lipids in plasma than in urine is consistent with the absence of glomerular filtration of many lipids (Fig. 2b). Associations detected in both plasma and urine generally affected the levels of the implicated metabolite in the same direction (Fig. 2a). Sensitivity analyses evaluating additional masks and methods for aggregation testing (LoF only, sequence kernel association test (SKAT) and SKAT- optimal unified test (SKAT-O)) as well as sex-stratified and kidney function-stratified analyses supported the robustness of the main findings (Supplementary Results, Extended Data Figs. 1-3 and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5).\n\nPrevious  independent  studies  of  associations  between sequencing-based rare variants and metabolite levels obtained using comparable technology have focused on plasma and serum 14,15,19,20 . Comparison of the 128 discovered gene-plasma metabolite associations in this study with previous studies 14,15,19,20 showed that 69% (88 of 128) were not reported previously, although 93% (82 of 88) of the new findings involved metabolites analyzed before (Supplementary Table 6; detailed description in the Supplementary Methods and the Supplementary Results).\n\nThe 73 unique metabolite-associated genes were strongly overrepresented among genes known to be causative for IEMs (odds ratio = 10.6, P value = 1.9 \u00d7 10 -14 ; Supplementary Methods), with 28 (38%) of them currently known to harbor causative mutations (Supplementary Table 6). The QVs detected in our study of middle-aged and older adults were almost exclusively observed in the heterozygous state (Supplementary Data 1). Detailed annotation of QVs in the two masks (Supplementary Table 7) showed that 63 unique QVs in 15 genes and 73 unique QVs in 17 genes were listed in ClinVar as 'pathogenic' or 'pathogenic or likely pathogenic' for a corresponding monogenic disease. These observations support the notion that gene-based aggregation of rare, heterozygous, putatively damaging variants effectively identifies gene-metabolite relationships implicated in human diseases.\n\nFig. 2 | Overview of the 192 identified gene-metabolite associations across plasma and urine and their corresponding pathways. a , Significant associations with plasma metabolites are shown on the outermost band (red; shading reflects effect direction), with genes ordered by chromosomal location across the genome. Associations with urine metabolites are shown on the middle band (blue; shading reflects effect direction). Gene-metabolite associations are based on rare variant aggregation testing from both masks. The ones labeled in gray were already reported in previous rare variant studies 14-20,24 , whereas the ones labeled in black are considered new. White spaces indicate that no significant association was detected in a given matrix. For all associations detected in both matrices, effect directions are consistent. The inner band represents the superpathway of the associated metabolite. GPE, glycero-3phosphoethanolamine; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; DC, dicarboxylic\n\n## Validation through independent, complementary approaches\n\nIndependent replication of our findings is complicated by differences in QVs, metabolite quantification methods and different analytical choices across studies. We therefore validated our findings using four complementary approaches: first, the large UKB permitted analysis of the same rare QVs using the same analytical choices (Methods), as in our study for two overlapping metabolites, and showed very similar effect sizes for gene-metabolite associations (Fig. 3a). Second, the UKB proteomics data 26 contain information on circulating levels of the encoded proteins of 17 genes implicated in our study. Burden tests aggregating protein-truncating and rare damaging variants revealed associations with lower levels of 15 of these proteins (in cis , P value &lt; 1 \u00d7 10 -5 ; Fig. 3b) 27 , potentially explained by nonsense-mediated decay. Third, comparison of our findings to those from a previous study of the plasma metabolome 15 showed highly correlated effect sizes with those from our study, both on the variant level and the aggregated level (Spearman correlation coefficient &gt; 0.8; Fig. 3c,d and Supplementary Table 8).\n\nLastly, we performed a proof-of-concept experimental validation study for an implicated gene-metabolite relationship. The B AT1 0 transporter, encoded by SLC6A19 , is responsible for the uptake of neutral amino acids across the apical membrane of intestinal and kidney epithelial cells 28 . In addition to associations with the levels of the known substrates asparagine, histidine and tryptophan, we also detected associations with methionine sulfone, not yet reported as a substrate. Transport studies in CHO cells overexpressing human SLC6A19 and its co-chaperone collectrin (CLTRN) in comparison to the control indeed confirmed methionine sulfone to be a substrate of the transporter in vitro, in a similar concentration range as its known substrate isoleucine (Fig. 4a and the Methods). Specificity was shown by complete inhibition of transport activity upon application of the SLC6A19 inhibitor cinromide 29 (Fig. 4b). Together, these four complementary lines of evidence all support the validity of the detected associations.\n\n## Prioritization and characteristics of driver variants\n\nWe next performed a forward selection procedure 15 to assess the contribution of individual QVs to their gene-based association signals (Methods). Plots that visualize the association P value based on the successive aggregation of the most influential QVs (Supplementary Data 2) revealed noteworthy differences across genes and metabolites, with examples detailed in the Supplementary Results.\n\nThe inclusion of effectively neutral variants among the QVs may dilute their joint signal. We thus prioritized the variants with the strongest individual contributions that resulted in the lowest possible association P value when aggregated for burden testing 15 as 'driver variants' (Methods). For each significant association signal, we identified at least two and up to 48 driver variants (median of 13; Supplementary Data 2 and Supplementary Tables 3 and 7). The proteins encoded by the vast majority of identified genes are directly involved in the generation, turnover or transport of the associated acid. b , The UpSet plot shows the number of identified gene-metabolite associations by mask and matrix, color coded by the respective metabolite superpathway. Right, horizontal bar plot represents the total number of associations identified by mask and matrix. The proportion of lipids is markedly higher among associations detected with plasma metabolites as compared with urine. Top left, vertical bar plot shows the number of shared associations by mask and matrix, while the sets among which the associations are shared are indicated below each column. While the majority of associations are detected by both masks, especially the less-stringent HI\\_mis mask provides many mask-specific findings in both plasma and urine. The group of metabolites detected in both plasma and urine is dominated by amino acids. Part. charact., partially characterized.\n\na\n\nSet size\n\n120\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fig. 3 | Independent validation of findings using orthogonal approaches.\n\na , Gene-based testing of significantly associated, available plasma metabolites among \u2265261,661 UKB participants ( y axis) using the same mask and only including QVs available in both the GCKD study and the UKB provided very similar effect sizes in the two studies ( x axis). Bars represent corresponding standard errors (SE), symbol color reflects the -log 10 ( P value), and the size depicts the cumulative minor allele frequency of all QVs within a gene. In the UKB, gene-based burden tests were performed as implemented in REGENIE (Methods). cMAF, cumulative MAF. b , Plasma levels of the proteins encoded by 17 of the 73 significant, metabolite-associated genes were measured in the UKB ( N \u2265 44,108) 27 . Among the available gene-level summary statistics 27 , 15 genes showed cis associations with plasma protein levels with an association P value &lt; 1 \u00d7 10 -5 based on a 'ptvraredmg' mask, which is similar to the masks used in the GCKD study. Genes are shown on the y axis. Effect sizes and the corresponding standard errors of the cis associations with plasma protein levels based on these summary statistics 27 are displayed on the x axis. Symbol color reflects the -log 10 ( P value). For all cis associations, the direction of effect sizes was negative, consistent with LoF variants resulting in lower plasma protein levels. c , Single-variant effect sizes on levels of a given plasma metabolite in the GCKD study ( x axis) were very similar to those in the INTERVAL study (Bomba et al. 15 ) ( y axis) for all QVs involved in metabolite(s). It is therefore a reasonable assumption that truly functional variants are those with the strongest individual contributions to the association signal with the implicated metabolite. Indeed, the minimum association P value based on only driver variants was often many orders of magnitude lower than the one obtained from all QVs, as exemplified by DPYD and plasma uracil (Supplementary Data 2). As expected, the proportion of splice, stop-gain and frameshift variants was higher among driver QVs, whereas nondriver QVs contained a greater proportion of missense variants (Fisher's exact test,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsignificant gene-metabolite associations in the GCKD study that were also available in the INTERVAL study and showed an association P value &lt; 0.1 in both studies.

The depicted 200 associations involved 35 unique genes and 75 unique metabolites. Symbol color indicates the INTERVAL association P value. Gray lines represent identity (dotted) and the linear regression line (dashed). The strong correlation of effect sizes supports reproducibility. d , Summary statistics for 89 of 128 plasma genemetabolite associations were available in the INTERVAL study (Bomba et al.). Effect sizes of gene-metabolite associations on the aggregated level in the GCKD study ( x axis) were very similar to those in the INTERVAL study ( y axis; Methods and Supplementary Table 8), despite differences in masks and aggregation unit. Horizontal error bars indicate the standard errors of effect sizes in the GCKD study. Standard errors were not available in the summary statistics from Bomba et al. Symbol shape indicates the corresponding mask used by Bomba et al. (LOF, high-confidence LoF variants; MLOF, LoF and missense variants combined; CODING, all rare exonic variants, splice sites and variants residing in untranslated regions). Color reflects the association P value in the INTERVAL study. Gray lines represent the identity (dotted) and the linear regression line (dashed).\n\nP value = 1.3 \u00d7 10 -6 ; Extended Data Fig. 4a). The median effect of driver variants on metabolite levels increased from missense over start/stop lost, frameshift and stop-gain variants to variants predicted to affect splicing (Extended Data Fig. 4b). The median effect of drivers also increased with lower minor allele count and differed substantially from the one of nondrivers in each minor allele count bin (Extended Data Fig. 4c).\n\nLastly, evaluation of the convergence of rare and common variant association signals showed that the associations of rare and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n-50\n\nFig. 4 | Methionine sulfone is a direct SLC6A19 substrate in vitro. a , Transport of L-isoleucine and methionine sulfone in CHO cells overexpressing SLC6A19 (SLC6A19 cells) and its chaperone CLTRN versus mock cells.

Data were generated from four biological replicates and are represented as mean \u00b1 s.d. EC 50 , half-maximum\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncommon variants in the same region with a given metabolite were independent (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Table 9 and Extended Data Fig. 5).\n\n## Heterozygous variants inform about dose-response effects\n\nThe identification of known IEM-causing variants such as in CTH PAH , , SLC6A19 and SLC7A9 (Supplementary Table 7) in the heterozygous state supports the notion that heterozygous QVs are functional alleles that lead to more extreme metabolic changes when present homozygously. For three genes with a homozygous QV present in more than one individual in our study, homozygous individuals tended to have more extreme metabolite levels than heterozygous ones (Extended Data Fig. 6), supporting a dose-response effect. Moreover, we had previously confirmed experimentally that heterozygous sulfate-associated QVs in SLC26A1 detected by aggregate variant testing are indeed LoF alleles and that the encoded protein is an important player in human sulfate homeostasis 30 . However, experimental studies of each of the 2,077 QVs and 73 genes detected here are infeasible, and IEMs are so rare that no homozygous person for a given gene may have been observed yet. We therefore used three orthogonal approaches: examination of hemizygosity, in silico knockout modeling and investigation of variants prioritized through allelic series, to evaluate whether the observed metabolite-associated heterozygous variants captured similar information about a gene's function as might be derived from homozygous damaging variants in the respective gene.\n\n## X chromosomal genes as a readout of variant homozygosity\n\nGenes in the non-pseudo-autosomal region of the X chromosome offer an opportunity to study differences between heterozygous women and effectively homozygous (that is, hemizygous) men. We therefore investigated sex differences for the two X chromosomal genes identified in our screen, TMLHE and RGN (Supplementary Table 10).\n\nIndeed, male carriers of QVs in TMLHE showed clearly higher urine levels of N N N 6 , 6 , 6 -trimethyllysine, the substrate of the encoded enzyme trimethyllysine dioxygenase, than female carriers as well as markedly lower levels of its product hydroxyN N N 6 , 6 , 6 -trimethyllysine, especially when focusing on driver variants (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 10). In plasma, male QV carriers showed 1.15 s.d. lower levels of plasma hydroxyN N N 6 , 6 , 6 -trimethyllysine than noncarriers ( P value = 6 \u00d7 10 -44 ), whereas female QV carriers only showed 0.45 s.d. lower metabolite levels than noncarriers ( P value = 3 \u00d7 10 -4 ). A similar tendency was observed for RGN and urine levels of the unnamed metabolite X-23436. Levels were higher among both male and female carriers (Supplementary Table 10), suggesting that X-23436 is a metabolite upstream of the reaction catalyzed by the encoded regucalcin. Data from the GTEx Project 31 show no sex differences in gene expression across tissues. Hence, sex-differential effects on metabolite levels likely represent a dose-response effect resulting from heterozygosity versus hemizygosity of the involved QVs.\n\n## Virtual IEMs mirror the effects of heterozygous variants\n\nWe next investigated the implicated genes' LoF by generating virtual IEMs for 24 genes that covered 60 gene-metabolite pairs via in silico knockout modeling (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 7). We compared the maximal secretion flux of the implicated metabolite into blood and/or urine between the wild-type WBM and the gene-knockout WBM. Initially, the direction of the observed gene-metabolite associations was correctly predicted by virtual IEMs with an accuracy of 73.3% in the male WBM and 76.7% in the female WBM, which is significantly better than chance (Fisher's exact test, P value = 3.3 \u00d7 10 -3 (male), P value = 1.5 \u00d7 10 -4 (female); Supplementary Table 11). After model curation informed by the observed gene-metabolite associations, which included the addition of metabolites (for example, 8-methoxykynurenate) and pathways as well as alteration of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCarriers of QVs in\n\nTMLHE\n\nCarriers of QVs in\n\nTMLHE\n\nconstraints (for example, diet; details in the Supplementary Results and Supplementary Table 12), the number of modeled gene-metabolite associations increased to 67, and accuracy increased to 79.1%\n\n(male, P value = 2.1 \u00d7 10 -5 ) and 83.58% (female, P value = 2.9 \u00d7 10 -7 ). These findings underline the predictive nature of the virtual IEMs for the aggregated effects of heterozygous damaging variants and\n\nhighlight opportunities to further improve WBMs by curation of the underlying knowledge base.\n\n## Personalized WBMs capture observed metabolic changes\n\nVirtual IEMs as described above only allow for qualitative prediction. To additionally study an equivalent to observed effect sizes, we introduced a second modeling strategy (Extended Data Fig. 7) as proof of principle, focusing on the gene KYNU . We successfully generated 569 microbiome-personalized 32 WBMs (Methods) and calculated the effect size of in silico KYNU knockout on metabolite excretion into urine against the natural variation induced by the personalized microbiomes (Supplementary Table 13). Eighteen of 257 metabolites had a modeling P value &lt; 0.05/257, implicating them as potential biomarkers of the corresponding IEM kynureninase deficiency (Supplementary Table 14). The in silico effects of these 18 biomarkers, mostly belonging to tryptophan metabolism and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)  de novo + synthesis pathway, were significantly correlated with their observed counterparts (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Whereas two of the three metabolites with particularly large effects in both in silico modeling and the GCKD study, xanthurenate and 3-hydroxykynurenine, are known biomarkers of kynureninase deficiency 33 , 8-methoxykynurenate was not. We therefore measured absolute levels of these metabolites in urine samples from a homozygous patient with kynureninase deficiency and her parents 34 (Supplementary Methods) and confirmed that, in addition to xanthurenate and 3-hydroxykynurenine, 8-methoxykynurenate also constituted a biomarker of this IEM (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 8), consistent with the association statistics from aggregate tests of heterozygous variants from the GCKD study. A similar observation was made with regard to the gene PAH (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Fig. 2b and Supplementary Results). Thus, in silico knockout modeling of two proof-of-principle examples faithfully captured metabolic changes observed for heterozygous variants detected in population studies and for the corresponding recessively inherited IEMs.\n\n## Metabolites represent intermediate readouts of human traits\n\nAllelic series describe a dose-response relationship, in which increasingly deleterious mutations in a gene result in increasingly larger effects on a trait or a disease. We hypothesized that genetic effects on metabolite levels should manifest as allelic series if the metabolite represents a molecular readout of an underlying (patho-)physiological process. As proof of principle, we investigated plasma sulfate because of solid evidence for causal gene-metabolite relationships: first, QVs in SLC13A1 showed a significant aggregate effect on lower plasma sulfate levels ( P value = 3 \u00d7 10 -18 , lowest possible P value = 2 \u00d7 10 -25 ). The observed association is well supported by experimental studies establishing that the encoded Na -sulfate cotransporter NaS1 (SLC13A1) reabsorbs + filtered sulfate at the apical membrane of kidney tubular epithelial cells 35 . Second, we had previously confirmed experimentally that plasma sulfate-associated QVs in SLC26A1 are LoF alleles that lead to reduced sulfate transport 30 , consistent with the aggregate effect of\n\n## Fig. 6 | Altered metabolite levels are a readout of impaired KYNU and PAH\n\nfunction: converging evidence from three approaches.a b , , Three panels are shown for 8-methoxykynurenate levels associated with KYNU ( a ) and for phenylalanine levels associated with PAH ( b ) that visualize evidence from three complementary approaches.

The encoded sulfate transporter SAT1 localizes to basolateral membranes of tubular epithelial cells and works in series with NaS1 to mediate transcellular sulfate reabsorption (Fig. 7a) 36,37 .\n\nBased on a growth retardation phenotype in Slc13a1 -knockout mice 38 and an association between SLC13A1 and lower sitting height in the UKB ( P value = 3 \u00d7 10 -8 ; Supplementary Tables 15 and 39), we investigated relations of six functional driver QVs in SLC13A1 and SLC26A1 with anthropometric measurements in the UKB (Methods). Supplementary Table 16 contains traits with which at least two QVs showed nominally significant associations ( P value &lt; 0.05). The genetic effect sizes on plasma sulfate levels in the GCKD study and both sitting and standing heights in the UKB were correlated (Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.57 and 0.70, respectively; Fig. 7b). These observations support a causal relationship between transcellular sulfate reabsorption and human height and designate plasma sulfate as an intermediate readout. Additionally, we observed significantly lower standing height among carriers of driver variants in SLC13A1 and SLC26A1 than among noncarriers in a subsample of the GCKD study ( N = 3,239) with measured height. The aggregated effect size of driver variants in SLC13A1 was -0.54 (corresponding to -5.17 cm when height was not inverse normal transformed, P value = 1.6 \u00d7 10 -3 ; Supplementary Fig. 3a). For SLC26A1 , we obtained even a stronger effect size of -0.73 (corresponding to -6.68 cm, P value = 1.7 \u00d7 10 -6 ; Supplementary Fig. 3b).\n\nThe first patient homozygous for a LoF stop-gain mutation in SLC13A1 , p.Arg12*, has just been described 39 . Aside from sitting height &gt;2 s.d. below the normal range, the patient featured multiple skeletal abnormalities. Experimental transport studies 40 as well as the patient's fractional sulfate excretion of almost 100% 39 establish this variant as a complete LoF, resulting in renal sulfate wasting. In this study, we found that, compared with noncarriers of p.Arg12*, heterozygous carriers showed 0.95 s.d. lower plasma sulfate levels (GCKD, 22 carriers, P value = 9.9 \u00d7 10 -10 ) and 0.08 s.d. lower sitting height (UKB, 2,480 carriers, P value = 2.2 \u00d7 10 -7 ). Plasma sulfate measurements from heterozygous carriers therefore are indicative of more extreme phenotypic changes in homozygous carriers.\n\n## Variants altering sulfate uptake and musculoskeletal traits\n\nRare LoF variants in SLC13A1 and SLC26A1 have been linked to individual musculoskeletal phenotypes through IEMs and GWASs 30,41-43 . We further investigated the association between the same six functional, sulfate-associated QVs in SLC13A1 and SLC26A1 and musculoskeletal disorders, fractures and injuries in the UKB, for which at least two carriers with and without disease were present (Methods). There were 116 nominally significant ( P value &lt; 0.05) associations with clinical traits and diseases, 113 of which were associated with increased odds of disease (Fig. 7c). For instance, the odds of various fractures ranged up to 30.7 (closed fracture of the neck, P value = 2.1 \u00d7 10 -8 , NaS1 p.Trp48*; Supplementary Table 17). While the increased odds a , Right, multiple-reaction monitoring ( m z / 220.0 \u2192 174.1) chromatograms of the diluted urine of a child with a homozygous loss of KYNU function 34 (patient), the heterozygous mother and the healthy father (maternal uniparental isodisomy). The signal at 12.5 min representing 8-methoxykynurenate is strongly enhanced in the patient sample. Chromatograms are normalized to urine creatinine concentrations; y axes are normalized to the intensity of the signal in the patient's chromatograms. b , Right, UV-visible chromatograms (570 nm) of amino acids (post-column derivatization with ninhydrin) in serum samples of a child with a homozygous loss of PAH function (c.1199+1G&gt;C), the compound heterozygous father who additionally carries a mild mutation (c.1180G&gt;C) and the heterozygous mother. The signal at 85.5 min represents phenylalanine (Phe). The signal at 106 min is the internal standard (IS). The reference range for phenylalanine concentrations in children is 38-137 \u00b5mol l -1 and in adults is 26-91 \u00b5mol l -1 .\n\nsupport a relationship between LoF variants in sulfate transporters and predisposition to several musculoskeletal disorders, the power to detect decreased odds was limited because of the rareness of the QVs and many of the disorders.\n\nUKB participants who carried more than one copy of any of the six QVs were investigated more closely. The rare allele, resulting in the p.Arg272Cys substitution in NaS1, was observed in nine heterozygous carriers in the GCKD study and prioritized because of its location in a\n\n## 8-methoxykynurenate and KYNU a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFig. 7 | Impact of functional QVs in SLC13A1 and SLC26A1 on height, musculoskeletal traits and fractures supports the role of plasma sulfate as an intermediate readout.a , Schematic representation of the sulfate reabsorption mechanism involving NaS1 encoded by SLC13A1 at the apical membrane and SAT1 encoded by SLC26A1 at the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells.

Variant effect sizes for\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsplice region, its high impact on plasma sulfate levels and its particularly large effect on human height (Fig. 7b). In the UKB, we found 294 heterozygous carriers of p.Arg272Cys, four persons who carried both p.Arg272Cys in NaS1 and p.Leu348Pro in SAT1 and a single person homozygous for p.Arg272Cys. Age- and sex-specific   scores for human z height showed a clear dose-response effect (Fig. 8a and the Methods). The stronger effects among the four individuals heterozygous for LoF variants in each of the two transcellular sulfate reabsorption proteins as compared with heterozygous carriers of p.Arg272Cys only support additive effects across the pathway for human growth. Carrier status for NaS1 p.Arg272Cys was associated with increased odds of several musculoskeletal diseases such as back pain and intervertebral disk disorders as well as fractures (Fig. 8b). Homozygous persons were also identified for NaS1 p.Arg12* and SAT1 p.Leu348Pro, with similar findings (Extended Data Fig. 10). Together, these findings provide strong support that genetic variants that proxy lower transcellular sulfate reabsorption are associated with human height and several musculoskeletal traits and diseases. Prioritizing variants with strong effects in allelic series for subsequent investigation in larger studies, even if the biomarker association rests on only a few heterozygous alleles, can therefore be an effective strategy to gain insights into the impact of rare damaging variants on human health.\n\n## Relation of metabolite-associated genes to clinical traits\n\nA query of associations between the identified 2,077 QVs and 73 genes with thousands of quantitative and binary health outcomes using data from ~450,000 UKB participants (Supplementary Methods) revealed multiple biologically plausible significant and suggestive associations for genes (Supplementary Table 15) and QVs (Supplementary Table 18) but also less-studied relationships (Supplementary Results). The genes SLC47A1 SLC6A19 SLC7A9 , , and SLC22A7 were associated with one or more measures of kidney function and encode transport proteins highly expressed in the kidney 44-46 . Their localization at the apical 44-46 versus basolateral membrane of tubular epithelial kidney cells 47 corresponded to the matrix (urine versus plasma) in which they left corresponding metabolic fingerprints. This observation illustrates that rare genetic\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nb\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nvariants associated with clinical markers of organ function can leave specific signatures in organ-adjacent biofluids that reflect their roles in cellular exchange processes.\n\n## Discussion\n\nWe performed a comprehensive screen of the aggregate effect of rare, putatively damaging variants on the levels of 1,294 plasma and 1,396 urine metabolites from paired specimens of 4,737 persons. The majority of the 192 identified gene-metabolite relationships have not been reported yet 14-20,24 and include plasma- and urine-exclusive associations that reflect organ function. The findings were validated through primary data analysis for metabolites available in the UKB, investigation of previously published summary statistics from sequencing-based genetic studies of the plasma metabolome, integration of orthogonal plasma proteomics data and proof-of-concept experimental studies that confirmed a new metabolite association with the transport protein encoded by SLC6A19 .\n\nWe show, via several genetic, computational and experimental  approaches that the rare, almost exclusively heterozygous metabolite-associated variants in our study capture similar information about a gene's function as can be obtained from the study of rare IEMs but are observed much more frequently and permit insights into graded effects of impaired gene function. First, 38% of identified genes in our study are known to harbor causative mutations for autosomal recessively inherited IEMs that often exhibit concordant but more extreme changes in the implicated metabolite, as exemplified by elevated urine levels of cystine in cystinuria (MIM 220100, SLC7A9 ) or tryptophan in Hartnup disease (MIM 234500, SLC6A19 ).\n\nSecond, men exhibited significantly larger effects of rare QVs in non-pseudo-autosomal X chromosomal genes on metabolite levels than women. This observation is consistent with male hemizygosity as an approximation of female homozygosity for a given variant and with the known greater penetrance and severity of X-linked disorders in men than in women 48 .\n\nThird, in silico knockout in a virtual metabolic human, that is, full loss of gene function, was predictive for observed metabolic changes associated with variant heterozygosity. Predicted changes on metabolite levels upon in silico gene knockout were also reflected in absolute metabolite quantification of patients with IEM homozygous for a LoF mutation in the respective genes, KYNU 34 and PAH . Thus, deterministic, knowledge-based in silico modeling generated context for better biological interpretation also of heterozygous variants, while genetic screens of metabolite levels in population studies permit the identification of knowledge gaps and errors in WBMs. Our modeling pipeline for generating virtual IEMs, which we make publicly available to substantiate evidence from rare variant aggregation tests, will constitute a valuable resource in particular to scrutinize genes for which an IEM has yet to be observed.\n\nFourth, the presence of different causal QVs affecting a given metabolic reaction or pathway enabled the investigation of allelic series. The resulting dose-response relationships proxy a range of target inhibition, which represents desirable information for drug development and is relevant because enzymes and transporters are attractive drug targets. Plasma sulfate-associated functional QVs in SLC13A1 and SLC26A1 showed a clear dose-response effect between the degree of genetically inferred impaired transcellular sulfate reabsorption\n\nand lower human height. This observation is biologically plausible, because defects in genes linked to sulfate biology often result in perturbed skeletal growth and development 49 . In particular, constitutive knockouts of Slc13a1 and Slc26a1 in mice do not only cause hyposulfatemia and renal sulfate wasting 38,50 but also general growth retardation in Slc13a1 -knockout mice 38 . Interestingly, the missense variant p.Thr185Met in SAT1 exhibited the largest effect on sulfate. We have previously shown experimentally a dominant negative mechanism of this variant 30 , providing another mechanism of how heterozygous variants may promote insights into an effectively full loss of gene function. Moreover, our findings for the p.Arg272Cys variant in NaS1 show that even very few, heterozygous copies of a metabolite-prioritized QV can give rise to the detection of homozygous individuals and hitherto unreported disease associations in subsequent larger studies. These observations suggest that the importance of impaired transcellular epithelial sulfate transport for musculoskeletal diseases, fractures and injuries deserves additional study and should be further substantiated through conditional or mediation analyses if plasma sulfate levels become available in the UKB.\n\nPotential limitations of our study include a focus on participants of European ancestry with moderately reduced kidney function, potential violations of assumptions underlying burden tests, in silico prediction of QV pathogenicity and of whole-body modeling and the use of semi-quantitative rather than absolute metabolite levels. Arguments mitigating each of these concerns are detailed in the Supplementary Discussion.\n\nIn conclusion, exome-wide population studies of rare, putative LoF variants can reveal potentially causal relationships with metabolites and highlight metabolic biomarkers informative of the degree of impaired gene function that can translate into graded associations with human traits.\n\n## Online content\n\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code availability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-024-01965-7.\n\n## References\n\n- 1.

Inclusion criteria were an age between 18 and 74 years and an eGFR between 30 and 60 ml min -1 per 1.73 m  or an eGFR &gt;60 ml min 2 -1 per 1.73 m 2 with a UACR &gt;300 mg per g or with a urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio &gt;500 mg per g 52 . Biomaterials, including blood and urine, were collected at the baseline visit, processed and shipped frozen to a central biobank for storage at -80 \u00b0C 53 . Details on the study design and participant characteristics have been published 52,54 . The GCKD study was registered in the national registry for clinical studies (DRKS 00003971) and approved by local ethics committees of the participating institutions 52 . All participants provided written informed consent.\n\n## Whole-exome sequencing and quality control\n\nGenomic DNA was extracted from whole blood and underwent paired-end 100-bp WES at Human Longevity, using the IDT xGen version 1 capture kit on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. More than 97% of consensus coding sequence (CCDS) release 22 (ref. 55) had at least 10-fold coverage. The average coverage of the CCDS was 141-fold read depth. Exomes were processed from their unaligned FASTQ state in a custom-built cloud compute platform using the Illumina DRAGEN Bio-IT Platform Germline Pipeline version 3.0.7 at AstraZeneca's Centre for Genomics Research, including alignment of reads to the GRCh38 reference genome (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/001/405/GCA\\_000001405.15\\_GRCh38/) and variant calling 56 .\n\nSample-level quality control included removal of samples from participants who withdrew consent, duplicated samples, those with an estimated VerifyBamID contamination level &gt;4% 57 , samples with inconsistency between reported and genetically predicted sex, samples not having chromosomes XX or XY, samples having &lt;94.5% of CCDS release 22 bases covered with \u226510-fold coverage 55 , related samples with kinship &gt;0.884 (KING, kinship version 2.2.3) 58 and samples with a missing call rate &gt;0.03. Furthermore, only samples with available high-quality DNA microarray genotype data and without outlying values (&gt;8 s.d.) along any of the first ten genetic principle components from a principal component analysis 59 were kept, for a final sample size of 4,779 samples.\n\nVariant-level quality control was performed similar to that in ref. 56, excluding variants with coverage &lt;10, heterozygous variants with a one-sided binomial exact test P value &lt;1 \u00d7 10 -6 for HardyWeinberg equilibrium, variants with a genotype quality score &lt;30, single-nucleotide variants with a Fisher's strand bias score (FS) &gt;60 and insertions and deletions with an FS &gt;200, variants with a mapping quality score &lt;40, those with a quality score &lt;30, variants with a read position rank-sum score &lt;-2, those with a mapping quality rank-sum score &lt;-8, variants that did not pass the DRAGEN calling algorithm filters, heterozygous genotype called variants based on an alternative allele read ratio &lt;0.2 or &gt;0.8 and variants with a missing call rate &gt;10% among all remaining samples. This resulted in 1,038,062 variants across the autosomes and the X chromosome.\n\n## Variant and gene annotation\n\nVariants from WES were annotated using the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) version 101 (ref. 60) with standard settings, including the canonical transcript, gene symbol and variant frequencies from gnomAD version 2.1 (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/). VEP plugins were used to add the REVEL (version 2020-5) 61 and CADD (version 3.0) 62 scores and to downgrade LoF variants using LOFTEE (version 20208) 63 . Furthermore, we added multiple in silico prediction scores using dbNSFP version 4.1a 64 .\n\nFor interpretation, genes were annotated for their potential function as enzymes using UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org/) 65 and as transporters using data from Gyimesi and Hediger 66 .\n\n## Metabolite identification and quantification\n\nMetabolite levels were quantified from stored plasma and spot urine as published by Schlosser et al. . In brief, nontargeted mass spectrometry 2 analysis was conducted at Metabolon. Metabolites were identified by automated comparison of the ion features in the experimental sample to a reference library of chemical standards. Known metabolites reported in this study were identified with the highest confidence level of identification of the Metabolomics Standards Initiative 67,68 , unless marked with an asterisk. Unnamed biochemicals of unknown structural identity were identified by virtue of their recurrent nature. For peak quantification, the area under the curve was used, followed by normalization to account for interday instrument variation.\n\n## Data cleaning of quantified metabolites\n\nData cleaning, quality control, filtering and normalization of quantified metabolites in plasma and urine in the GCKD study were performed using an in-house pipeline . Samples and metabolites were evaluated 2 for duplicates; missing and outlying values and metabolites with low variance were excluded. Levels of urine metabolites were normalized using the probabilistic quotient 69 derived from 309 endogenous metabolites with &lt;1% missing values to account for differences in urine dilution. After removing metabolites with &lt;300 individuals with WES data, the remaining 1,294 plasma and 1,396 urine metabolites (Supplementary Table 2) were inverse normal transformed before gene-based aggregation testing. Therefore, effect sizes based on effects of aggregated rare variants on the semi-quantitative metabolite measurements have 1 s.d. as a unit.\n\n## Additional variables\n\nSerum and urine creatinine were measured using an IDMS-traceable enzymatic assay (Creatinine Plus, Roche). Serum and urine albumin levels were measured using the Tina-quant assay (Roche-Hitachi Diagnostics). GFR was estimated with the CKD-EPI formula 70 from serum creatinine. UACR was calculated using urinary albumin and creatinine measurements. Full information on WES data, covariates and metabolites was available for 4,713 persons regarding plasma metabolites and for 4,619 persons regarding urine metabolites. Genetic principal components were derived based on principal component analysis on the basis of genotype data using flashpca 71 .\n\n## Rare variant aggregation testing on metabolite levels\n\nWe performed burden tests to combine the effects of rare, putatively damaging variants within a gene on metabolite levels assuming a LoF mechanism that results in concordant effect directions on metabolite levels 72 . The selection of high-quality QVs into masks based on their frequency and annotated properties is a state-of-the-art approach in variant aggregation studies 73 . Annotations from VEP version 101 (ref. 60) were used to select QVs within each gene for aggregation in burden tests. Because genetic architectures of damaging variants vary across genes, two complementary masks for the selection of QVs were defined. Both masks were restricted to contain only rare variants in canonical transcripts with MAF &lt;1%. All variants that were predicted to be either high-confidence LoF variants or missense variants with a MetaSVM score &gt;0 or in-frame nonsynonymous variants with a fathmm-XF-coding score &gt;0.5 were aggregated into the first mask, termed LoF\\_mis. The second mask, termed HI\\_mis, contained all variants that were predicted either to have a high-impact consequence defined by VEP (transcript ablation, splice acceptor variant, splice donor variant, stop-gain variant, frameshift variant, start/ stop lost variant, and transcript amplification) or to be missense variants with a REVEL score &gt;0.5, a CADD PHRED score &gt;20 or an\n\nM-CAP score &gt;0.025. Only genes with an HGNC symbol that were not read-throughs and that contained more than three QVs in at least one of the masks were kept for testing, resulting in 16,525 analyzed genes. Burden tests were carried out as implemented in the seqMeta R package version 1.6.7 (ref. 74), adjusting for age, sex, ln(eGFR) and the first three genetic principal components as well as serum albumin for plasma metabolites and ln(UACR) for urinary metabolites, respectively . Genotypes were coded as the number of copies of the 2 rare allele (0, 1, 2) on the autosomes and also on the X chromosome for women. For men, genotypes in the non-pseudo-autosomal region of the X chromosome were coded as (0, 2). Statistical significance was defined as nominal significance corrected for the number of tested genes and principal components that explained more than 95% of the metabolites' variance (0.05/16,525/600 = 5.04 \u00d7 10 -9 in plasma, 0.05/16,525/679 = 4.46 \u00d7 10 -9 in urine). For significant gene-metabolite associations, single-variant association tests between each QV in the respective mask and the corresponding metabolite levels were performed under additive modeling, adjusting for the same covariates using the seqMeta R package version 1.6.7 (ref. 74). Sensitivity analyses that evaluated all significant gene-metabolite pairs with regard to additional gene-based tests as well as across strata of sex and kidney function are summarized in the Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5.\n\n## Assessment of QV contributions and driver variants\n\nThe investigation of the genetic architecture underlying gene-metabolite associations and the prioritization of QVs according to their contribution to the gene-based association signal were performed using the forward selection procedure from Bomba et al. 15 . First, for each QV v , the P value Pv is calculated by performing the burden test aggregating all QVs other than v . Second, for each QV v , the difference \u2206  between v Pv and the total P value of the burden test including all QVs is calculated. Subsequently, QVs are ranked by the magnitude of \u2206 . QVs not v contributing to the gene signal or even having an opposite effect can provide a negative \u2206 . Finally, burden tests are performed by adding v the ranked QVs one after the other until the lowest P value is reached, starting with the greatest \u2206 . This identified a set of QVs that contained v only variants that contributed most to the gene-metabolite association signal (that is, led to a stronger association signal) and did not contain variants that introduced noise (that is, neutral variants or those with a small or even opposite effect on metabolite levels). The resulting set of selected variants that led to the lowest possible association P value was designated 'driver variants' for the respective gene-metabolite association. Driver variants within a gene might differ for different associated metabolites.\n\n## Relation of QVs in SLC13A1 and SLC26A1 to musculoskeletal traits\n\nWES and biomedical data of the UKB were used to investigate allelic series of functional QVs in SLC13A1 and SLC26A1 with hypothesized related clinical traits and diseases. We focused on SLC13A1 driver variants with experimental validation or that likely result in a severe consequence (stop-gain, splicing) to select truly functional QVs. Among these, the stop-gain variant encoding p.Arg12*, for which a complete LoF has experimentally been validated 40 , the stop-gain substitution p.Trp48*, for which associations with decreased serum sulfate levels 42 and skeletal phenotypes 41 were reported, and the missense variant encoding p.Arg272Cys, located in a splice region, were available in the UKB. For SLC26A1 , we selected driver QVs for which reduced sulfate transport activity had previously been shown 30 , of which p.Leu384Pro, p.Ser358Leu and p.Thr185Met were available in the UKB. All 6 QVs passed the '90pct10dp' QC filter, defined as at least 90% of all genotypes for a given variant, independent of variant allele zygosity, had a read depth of at least 10 (https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/ukb/ukb/docs/ UKB\\_WES\\_AnalysisBestPractices.pdf).\n\nAnalyses were performed on the UKB Research Analysis Platform. Participants with all ancestries were included into the analysis but excluding strongly related individuals, defined as those that were excluded from the kinship inference process and those with ten or more third-degree relatives. After individual-level filtering, 468,292 individuals remained for analyses. Of these, ten participants were homozygous for one of the six QVs and 7,280 persons were heterozygous for at least one of the QVs. For these homozygous or heterozygous persons, we determined age- and sex-specific   scores of their quantitaz tive anthropometric measurements, enabling interpretation of their measurements compared with noncarriers of the same age and sex. Age- and sex-specific distributions were inverse normal transformed before calculating   scores. z\n\nThe association between each of the six functional QVs with medical diagnoses defined by International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10) codes based on UKB field 41202 (primary or main diagnosis codes across hospital inpatient records) was investigated. We selected musculoskeletal diseases (ICD-10 codes starting with 'M') and fractures and injuries (ICD-10 codes starting with 'S' and containing 'fracture', 'dislocation' or 'sprain' terms). To avoid unreliable estimates, traits were restricted to those with at least two rare variant carriers among both individuals with and without disease. The association was examined using Fisher's exact test under dominant modeling and Firth regression under additive modeling ('brglm2' R package 75 ). We included sex, age at recruitment, sex \u00d7 age and the first 20 genetic principal components (UKB field 22009) as covariates in the regression model. The association with quantitative anthropometric traits was assessed after inverse normal transformation via linear regression, additive genotype modeling and adjusting for the same covariates.\n\n## Gene-based tests for metabolite associations in the UK Biobank\n\nWe performed gene-based tests for significantly associated metabolites available in the UKB to validate our findings using the same settings for analysis as those in our study. Because metabolite levels in the UKB were quantified by Nightingale Health's metabolic biomarker platform focusing on lipids, only two (histidine and phenylalanine) of the 122 significantly associated plasma metabolites were available.\n\nHistidine and phenylalanine values (UKB data fields 23463 and 23468) were inverse normal transformed. Sample and variant QC was performed, and covariates were included as described in the previous paragraph. A total of 260,000 individuals were available for analysis. Association analysis for the two identified gene-metabolite pairs, histidine and HAL as well as phenylalanine and PAH , was performed based on burden tests as implemented in REGENIE version 3.3 in two steps using the HI\\_mis mask, selecting only QVs that were present in the GCKD study to ensure reproducibility of rare variant effects between the studies.\n\n## Setup of the whole-body model and mapping\n\nThe sex-specific and organ-resolved WBM covers 13,543 unique metabolic reactions and 4,140 unique metabolites based on the generic genome-scale reconstruction of human metabolism, Recon3D 23 , and adequate physiological and coupling constraints 22,24 .\n\nOf all observed significant gene-metabolite pairs from the GCKD study, 51 genes and 69 metabolites could be mapped onto Recon3D. For 36 of 51 genes, their associated metabolites could be mapped, resulting in 69 unique gene-metabolite pairs. To investigate perturbations in gene G , we first identified all reactions RG = { r G \u0161 , \u2026 , r Gn } of the corresponding encoded enzymes or transporters in the WBM 76 . We included those genes (27 of 36) in the generation of virtual IEMs that were exclusively causal for a non-empty set of reactions (that is, for a gene G , associated with reactions RG = { r G \u0161 , \u2026 , r Gn } , there did not exist a gene H that was associated with any reaction of RG ) and metabolites with urinary excretion reactions, leading to the exclusion of SLC22A7 and SULT2A1 .\n\n## In silico knockout modeling via linear programming\n\nKnockout simulations were based on maximizing the flux of the excretion or demand reaction of the metabolite of interest M under different conditions in a steady state setting ( Sv = 0 ), where S is the stoichiometric matrix (rows, metabolites; columns, reactions), and v is the flux vector through each reaction, adhering to specific constraints ( vl \u2264 v \u2264 vu ) 22,77 :\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFor simulating a wild-type model for gene G , we solved the linear programming (LP) problem stated in equation (1), choosing the linear objective as the sum of all corresponding fluxes of reactions in RG :\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFirst, we checked whether SG &gt; 10 -6 , a criterion implemented in the function checkIEM\\_WBM of the PSCM toolbox for deciding whether the corresponding reactions could carry any flux 22,78 . All reactions except the TMLHE -associated reactions passed this criterion.\n\nNext, we maximized the flux of two key reactions: the urine excretion reaction (for example, EX M [ u ]) and the created unbounded demand reaction (for example, DM M [ bc ]), designed to reflect accumulation in the blood compartment. First, we unbounded the upper bound of the urine excretion reaction. Next, we maximized the corresponding fluxes of metabolite M as the LP problem stated in equation (1) under the additional constraint that \u2211 = n k \u0161 vGk = SG , providing the maximal urine excretion and the maximal flux into blood given the constraint setting. Finally, to simulate the complete LoF, we blocked all reactions in all organs catalyzed by gene G by setting vG \u0161 = \u2026 = vGn = \u0160 . We derived maximum fluxes as in the wild-type model. Subsequently, we tested whether the knockout resulted in an increase, a decrease or no change in EX M [ u ] and DM M [ bc ] for each mapped gene-metabolite pair that was significant in the GCKD cohort.\n\nFrom the initial 36 genes mapped onto Recon3D, 24 genes and their mapped metabolites fulfilled all criteria (exclusively causal, reactions of the genes carry flux, urinary excretion reaction present), leading to 60 modeled gene-metabolite pairs. After curation of the male and female models, 26 genes ( TMLHE and KYAT1 added) and 67 gene-metabolite pairs could be computed (Supplementary Methods).\n\nLP simulations were carried out in Windows 10 using MATLAB 2021a (MathWorks) as the simulation environment, ILOG CPLEX version 12.9 (IBM) as the LP solver, the COBRA Toolbox version 3.4 (ref. 78) and the PSCM toolbox 22 .\n\n## Microbiome personalization of whole-body models\n\nMicrobiome-personalized WBMs were generated by creating community models based on the genome-scale reconstructions of microbes in the AGORA1 resource 79,80 . Models have been shown to accurately reflect aspects of the fecal host metabolome 80,81 . Briefly, from microbe identification and relative abundance data of a metagenomic sample, genome-scale reconstructions of the identified microbes are joined together and connected via a lumen compartment, where they can exchange metabolites to form a microbial community 82,83 . Each microbial community model is then integrated in the WBM by connecting the microbiota lumen compartment to the large intestinal lumen of the WBM. Microbial community models ( n = 616) were based on publicly available metagenomics data from Yachida et al. 32 and then embedded into the male WBM to form 616 personalized WBMs.\n\n## In silico knockout modeling using quadratic programming\n\nWhile maintaining the same conditions as outlined in equation (1), rather than maximizing a linear objective, we minimized a quadratic objective for each personalized WBM:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, Q is a diagonal matrix, with 10 -6 on its diagonal, a value recommended in the COBRA Toolbox 78 . Because of convexity attributes, equation (3) allows for calculation of a unique flux distribution. For each solution v * , we obtained the corresponding urine excretion reactions of the measured and mapped metabolites. For knockout simulations,  the  associated  reactions  of  gene G were  set  to  zero ( vG \u0161 = \u2026 = vGn = \u0160 ). Then, equation (3) was solved if possible. An optimal quadratic programming (QP) solution could be computed for 582 wild-type models, 590 KYNU -knockout WBMs and 588 PAH -knockout WBMs, which led to 569 paired QPKYNU solutions and 567 paired QPPAH solutions. We analyzed urine secretion fluxes for 257 metabolites covered in the GCKD urine metabolome data and 272 metabolites covered in the GCKD plasma metabolome data that had non-zero flux values. For KYNU , the urine compartment was analyzed, as biomarker quantification for the corresponding IEM is done in urine. Analogously for PAH , the blood metabolome data were analyzed as the clinically relevant compartment. The QP simulations were carried out using the high-performance computing facility, called the Brain-Cluster, of the University of Greifs-wald, employing MATLAB 2019b (MathWorks), ILOG CPLEX version 12.10 (IBM) as the quadratic programming solver and the COBRA Toolbox version 3.4 (ref. 78).\n\n## Statistical analysis of the in silico simulation results\n\nThe Fisher-Freeman-Halton test was used to determine significance when comparing the in vivo and in silico signs from LP modeling. Statistical analysis of the QP solutions was conducted based on the paired wild-type and knockout fluxes via fixed-effect linear regression for panel data 84 . We used ln(urine secretion flux) as the response variable, the knockout status as the sole predictor (wild type versus knockout) and the personalized microbiome as a fixed effect. Significance thresholds were set to 0.05/257 ( KYNU ) and 0.05/272 ( PAH ). Importantly, the entire variance in the regression models had two sources: (1) the knockout and (2) the microbiome personalization. Significance testing of the in silico regression coefficient of the knockout variable therefore delivers a test of whether the knockout explains substantial amounts of variance in comparison to the variance induced by randomly sampled microbiome communities. The in silico regression coefficients were then correlated with the burden-derived observed regression coefficients of genemetabolite associations from the GCKD study, and significance was determined using the standard test for Pearson correlations.\n\n## Experiments on transport activity of SLC6A19\n\nGeneration of cells . Human SLC6A19 (NM\\_001003841.3 \u2192 NP\\_0010 03841.1) and human CLTRN TMEM27 ( ) (NM\\_020665.6 \u2192 NP\\_065716.1) cDNA was synthesized at Life Technologies Gene Art and cloned into a T-REx inducible expression vector. Both vectors were transfected into CHO T-REx cells and selected with neomycin and hygromycin. Mock cells were made by transfecting with only the TMEM27 vector and selection using hygromycin. Stable pools were then selected by measuring doxycycline-inducible uptake of neutral amino acids (for example, isoleucine) by measuring changes in membrane potential using the FLIPR Tetra system. The selected stable cell pools were then serially diluted to generate single-cell clones, which were subsequently selected based on function using the FLIPR assay and hSLC6A19 and hTMEM27 expression using qPCR.\n\nFLIPR membrane potential assay . CHO T-REx cells stably expressing doxycycline-inducible hSLC6A19 and hTMEM27 were seeded in a 384-well plate and incubated overnight with 1 \u00b5g ml -1 doxycycline. The next day, cells were washed and then incubated with Tyrode's buffer (sodium free) with FMP-Blue-Dye, which is a membrane potential dye, for 60 min. The cells were then incubated with standard Tyrode's buffer (130 mM NaCl) with and without cinromide for 10 min before incubation with standard Tyrode's buffer alone or with eight increasing concentrations of methionine sulfone and isoleucine, both with maximum concentrations of 30 mM. The FLIPR Tetra system was used to read FMP-Blue-Dye fluorescence as a measurement of membrane depolarization as a result of substrate-driven electrogenic net influx of Na . Data were analyzed and represented in two ways: (1) for data + comparison with the mock cell line, transport activity was presented as fold over non-substrate-driven signal with the formula (fluorescence signal - median of fluorescence signal with no substrate)/(median of fluorescence signal with no substrate); and (2) for data comparison with cinromide, transport activity was presented as a percent of maximum substrate-driven fluorescence signal with the formula 100 \u00d7 (fluorescence signal - median of fluorescence signal with no substrate)/ (median of fluorescence signal with substrate).\n\n## Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe summary statistics of all significant gene-metabolite associations based on burden tests using two masks as well as all involved QVs with annotations are available in Supplementary Tables 3 and 7, respectively.

(a) The bar plot represents the absolute frequency (y-axis) of each of the QVs' consequences with their proportions noted next to them, separately for driver and non-driver variants (x-axis). Whereas driver variants contain more splicing, stop-gain and frameshift variants, the proportion of missense variants is higher among non-driver variants (Fisher's exact test: P-value = 1.3e-6). (b) The swarm plot shows differences in absolute effect sizes for QVs (y-axis) across the five different consequence classes (x-axis). The color reflects the variant status (driver versus non-driver variant). Horizontal lines represent the median of the absolute effect sizes separately for driver and non-driver variants. The median effect of driver variants on metabolite levels increases when ordering the consequence classes with respect to severity (missense, start/stop-lost, frameshift, stop-gain, splicing). (c) The swarm plot shows differences in absolute effect sizes for QVs (y-axis) across groups of variants by minor allele count (MAC) bins (x-axis). Color reflects variant status (driver versus non-driver). Horizontal lines represent the median of the absolute effect sizes separately for driver and non-driver variants. The median effect of driver variants on metabolite levels increases with decreasing MAC bin, supporting that ultra-rare variants tend to have larger effects than those observed more frequently. In case one gene was significantly associated with levels of more than one metabolite, only the QVs from the strongest gene-metabolite associations are included (for only one matrix and only one mask) in each panel, to prevent counting variants multiple times, resulting in 1,885 QVs that were included in each panel.\n\nExtended Data Fig. 5 | Comparison and integration of rare and common variant association signals with metabolite levels within the same locus. under additive modeling (Supplementary Methods), across different cumulative\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(a) The scatter plot shows the absolute effect size (y-axis) of association signals with metabolite levels based on aggregating rare variants within a gene using burden tests and based on the common variant with the lowest significant individual association P-value within the same locus (\u00b1500 kb around the gene) minor allele frequencies (cMAF, for aggregated rare variants) and minor allele frequencies (MAF, for common variants) (x-axis). Colors indicate whether the corresponding association signal is based on shared rare or common variants or whether it is unique to the rare variant screen. The shape represents the matrix of the corresponding metabolite. The absolute effect size tends to increase with decreasing MAF/cMAF.

The models are derived from Thiele et al. 2020, PMID: 32463598. (b) Identify gene-reaction relations: For each Gene G , it is essential to identify every reaction carried out by the corresponding enzyme/transporter across all organs. The corresponding reactions W\u10bd \u17c6 \u00f7 -\u0161 \u1299\u190c\u1299 \u00f7 -\u00e7 \u17c7 are used for gene-knockout modeling in the linear programming (LP) and quadratic programming (QP) knockout methodologies. (c) Generation of microbiome-personalized whole-body models: Utilizing abundance-data of metagenomic samples, personalized gut microbiome community models are generated via combining the individually present genome-scale reconstructions of microbes in a common lumen compartment. The lumen compartment is then integrated with the whole-body model, thereby creating an individualized host-microbiome model. (d) LP gene-knockout modeling: The system of mass balance equations at steady state, as defined by the stoichiometric matrix S and constraints for each flux, forms a convex space of possible solutions for a vector v of fluxes of a WBM. The sum of fluxes of reactions in RG (expressed as \u10bd \u10bb\u17bf\u10bb ) is maximized, and this maximal value is subsequently\n\n[-\u0110\u0161 \u0110-\u00e7\n\nimposed as a constraint in the wild-type model. Setting all fluxes corresponding to the reactions in RG to zero forms the knockout model. The maximum flux of a biomarker vGM is computed in both models and compared with each other. (e) QP gene-knockout modeling: Each microbiome-personalized whole-body model spans up its individual wild-type solution space under steady state and constraint settings. The solution of the quadratic objective of the flux vector under steady state and constraints for each reaction of the WBM forms the wild-type solution for Harvey/Harvetta, denoted as \u0110 \u192e qa \u10bd \u10be \u0110 \u192e qa \u0161 \u1299 \u11a0 \u17bf\u11a0 \u0110 \u192e qa \u00e7 \u1299 \u10bf . Setting each flux of reaction in RG to zero and repeating the procedure yields the QP solution after knockout, \u0110 \u192e @L . The unique QP solutions across all samples allows for screening for differences within each reaction of the WBM to find possible biomarkers, and for the computation of effect sizes for each reaction.

Three panels are shown for 3-hydroxykynurenine (a) and xanthurenate (b) each: the left panel represents inverse-normal transformed, covariate-adjusted urine levels of the respective metabolite (y-axis) among non-carriers and carriers of QVs in KYNU (x-axis).

The boxes range from the 25 th to the 75 th percentile of metabolite levels, the median is indicated by a line, and whiskers end at the last observed value within 1.5*(interquartile range) away from the box. The middle panel represents the distribution of the ln-transformed urinary secretion flux of the respective metabolite in mmol/day into urine (y-axis) from min-norm simulations based on solutions of 569 microbiome-personalized whole-body models without and with simulated knockout of KYNU (x-axis).

The signals at 3.9 min (3-hydroxykynurenine) and 9.5 min (xanthurenate) are strongly enhanced in the patient sample. Chromatograms are normalized to urine creatinine concentrations; y-axes are normalized to the intensity of the signals in the patient's chromatograms. All three independent approaches arrive at the conclusion that elevated levels of 3-hydroxykynurenine and xanthurenate in urine are a readout of impaired KYNU function.\n\n## pla sma s ul fate* at SLC26A1 (LoF\\_mis)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExtended Data Fig. 9 | Contribution of individual QVs in SLC26A1 to their gene-based association signal with plasma sulfate levels.

Between 2010 and 2012, 5,217 adult persons with CKD under regular care by nephrologists provided written informed consent and were enrolled into the study at nine participating study centers across Germany (see below). Participants were included if they met inclusion criteria, but - as in all epidemiological studies - it cannot be excluded that eligible persons with many or severe comorbidities were less likely to participate than other eligible participants. For this project, all participants with available plasma or urine collected at the baseline visit and with available whole-exome sequencing data were selected (N=4,737).\n\nEthics oversight\n\nThe GCKD Study was registered in the national registry for clinical studies (DRKS 00003971) and approved by all local ethic committees of the nine participating centers (Universities or Medical Faculties of Aachen, Berlin, Erlangen, Freiburg, Hannover, Heidelberg, Jena, M\u00fcnchen, W\u00fcrzburg).\n\nNote that full information on the approval of the study protocol must also be provided in the manuscript.\n\n## Field-specific reporting\n\nPlease select the one below that is the best fit for your research.

The entire sample was therefore utilized, and no selection was made.\n\nData exclusions\n\nMetabolites were excluded for high proportions of missingness (&gt;93%). Samples were excluded if no high-quality whole-exome sequencing data was available. This is clearly described in the methods.\n\nReplication\n\nReplication of gene-metabolite associations based on aggregating rare damaging variants is difficult because of the non-availability of the same rare damaging variant in an independent cohort.\n\nTherefore, we evaluated reproducibility of our findings by different means :\n\n- We compared our identified gene-metabolite associations to those from 8 published studies that focused on rare variant aggregation testing of metabolite levels. For one published study of the plasma metabolome (based on MS-quantification) that made summary statistics accessible we compared effect sizes on the variant- and gene-level.\n\n- For overlapping metabolites, we conducted gene-based tests in the UKB using the same variants and tests as in our study.\n\n- We investigated the role of our metabolite-associated genes in currently known inborn errors of metabolism (IEM).\n\n- We used whole-body models where in silico gene knockouts were modeled to validate our identified gene-metabolite pairs.\n\n- We performed a proof-of-concept experimental validation study for an implicated metabolite not yet shown to be involved in the encoded protein's function.\n\nWhen information was available, each of these approaches supported the validity of findings.\n\nRandomization\n\nNot relevant to this study because this is an observational study.\n\nBlinding\n\nNot relevant to this study because this is an observational study.\n\n## Reporting for specific materials, systems and methods\n\nWe require information from authors about some types of materials, experimental systems and methods used in many studies.

Little is known about the mechanisms that mediate Lac-Phe transport across cell membranes. Here we identify SLC17A1 and SLC17A3, two kidney-restricted plasma membrane-localized solute carriers, as physiologic urine Lac-Phe transporters. In cell culture, SLC17A1/3 exhibit high Lac-Phe ef /uniFB02 ux activity. In humans, levels of Lac-Phe in urine exhibit a strong genetic association with the SLC17A1-4 locus. Urine LacPhe levels are increased following a Wingate sprint test. In mice, genetic ablation of either SLC17A1 or SLC17A3 reduces urine Lac-Phe levels. Despite these differences, both knockout strains have normal blood Lac-Phe and body weights, demonstrating SLC17A1/3-dependent de-coupling of urine and plasma Lac-Phe pools. Together, these data establish SLC17A1/3 family members as the physiologic urine Lac-Phe transporters and uncover a biochemical pathway for the renal excretion of this signaling metabolite.\n\nLactate is a fundamental metabolite that has attracted signi /uniFB01 cant biochemical and physiologic attention for over a century 1,2 . Classically, lactate is produced when energy demands are high, such as in muscle during exercise, and can reach millimolar concentrations in the circulation 3,4 . Once produced, lactate exerts pleotropic functions in systemic energy metabolism. These include serving as a metabolic fuel, tissue redox shuttling, signaling via cell surface receptors, and in the post-translational modi /uniFB01 cation of proteins 5 -8 .\n\nRecently, we showed that the metabolic functions of lactate also extend to lactate-derived metabolites. Speci /uniFB01 cally, we identi /uniFB01 ed Nlactoyl-phenylalanine (Lac-Phe) as an exercise- and metformin-inducible signaling molecule that regulates food intake and energy balance 9 11 -. Lac-Phe biosynthesis is mediated by CNDP2, a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the direct condensation of lactate and phenylalanine 12 . Genetic ablation of CNDP2 in mice reduces circulating basal and stimulated Lac-Phe levels. CNDP2-KO mice are hyperphagic and obese after exercise training and high fat diet feeding , establishing that Lac9 Phe is necessary for the suppression of feeding after exercise training. CNDP2-KOmicearealso resistant to the anorexigenic and body weightlowering effects of metformin therapy 10 , a pharmacological stimulus that increases glycolysis and lactate /uniFB02 ux and lowers body weight. Conversely, pharmacological administration of Lac-Phe is suf /uniFB01 cient to suppress feeding and obesity without affecting energy expenditure. In humans, higher post-exercise Lac-Phe levels are associated with greater reduction of adiposity following exercise training 13 , demonstrating conservation of this metabolite across multiple mammalian species.\n\nThree lines of evidence point to the existence of speci /uniFB01 c transporters that mediates active Lac-Phe ef /uniFB02 ux from cells. First, CNDP2 is an intracellular, cytosolic enzyme, yet Lac-Phe is enriched in the conditioned medium of cultured cells . This intracellular versus extra9 cellular distribution of CNDP2 and Lac-Phe, respectively, suggest active processes mediate ef /uniFB02 ux of Lac-Phe away from its site of production. Second, Lac-Phe is a polar metabolite and thus would not be expected to simply diffuse across lipid bilayers. Third, Lac-Phe can be actively translocated across the plasma membrane by transporters in cell culture. For instance, overexpression of ABCC5, one member of the ABC transporter family, increases Lac-Phe levels in conditioned media of cells 12 . However, there is no evidence that Lac-Phe levels are altered in ABCC5-KO mice 9 , suggesting that other, as of yet unidenti /uniFB01 ed plasma membrane carriers are the physiologically relevant transporters for Lac-Phe in vivo.\n\nHere we combine human metabolite-genome association data with biochemical studies in vitro and genetic studies in mice to demonstrate that Lac-Phe is an endogenous transport substrate for the SLC17 family of solute carriers. SLC17A1/3 are robust ef /uniFB02 uxers of LacPhe in cell culture and highly expressed in renal epithelial cells in mice and humans. Genetic individual ablation of SLC17A1 or SLC17A3 in mice results in reduced urine levels of Lac-Phe. Finally, we show that both SLC17A1- and SLC17A3-KO mice have normal levels of Lac-Phe in bloodandnormalbodyweights,providingevidenceforde-couplingof urine and plasma Lac-Phe pools and the presence of yet additional transporters that mediate Lac-Phe ef /uniFB02 ux into blood plasma.\n\n## Results\n\n## Re-assignment and genetic association of Lac-Phe with the SLC17A1-4 locus in human urine\n\nIn a 2020 metabolite genome-wide association study 14 , we noted the detection of a urine metabolite which was reported by Metabolon as both ' X-15497 ' and also ' X-15497retired for 1carboxyethylphenylalanine . In a subsequent 2023 study from the ' same group 15 , this X-15497/1-carboxyethylphenylalanine metabolite was re-assigned by Metabolon to a different chemical structure, N-lactoyl-phenylalanine (Lac-Phe). In both studies, urine levels of the X-15497/1-carboxyethylphenylalanine/Lac-Phe metabolite exhibited a strong genetic association with the human SLC17A1-4 locus (Fig. 1a-c). While 1-carboxyethylphenylalanine and Lac-Phe have identical molecular formulas and mass-tocharge ratios (C12H15NO4, m/z = 236.0928), these two molecules are in fact two distinct chemical entities. Until now, raw chromatographic or tandem mass spectrometry data were not available in either the 2020 or 2023 studies. Consequently, the precise chemical structure of this X-15497/1-carboxyethylphenylalanine/ Lac-Phe metabolite, and the signi /uniFB01 cance of its association with the SLC17A1-4 locus, remained unde /uniFB01 ned.\n\nWe /uniFB01 rst sought to de /uniFB01 nitively determine the chemical structure of the X-15497/1-carboxyethylphenylalanine/Lac-Phe metabolite. First, we compared tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra of authentic standards for Lac-Phe and 1-carboxyethylphenylalanine. Both exhibited a major daughter ion of m/z =88 corresponding to fragmentation of the amide N-C \u03b1 bond (Fig. 1e). In addition, the 1-carboxyethylphenylalanine standard produced a minor daughter ion of m/z =192whichwasabsentintheLac-Phestandard;wepresumethis m/z =192 daughter ion likely corresponds to decarboxylation of the 1-carboxyethyl portion of the molecule (Fig. 1e). The experimental MS/ MSforX-15497, which was obtained from Metabolon, also showed the major m/z =88 and no evidence for the m/z =192 daughter ion. These data demonstrate that the fragmentation pattern for the metabolite X-15497 is more alike to Lac-Phe than it is to 1-carboxyethylphenylalanine (Fig. 1e).\n\nWe also compared the retention time for the endogenous m/z =236.0928 peak from blood plasma and authentic samples of Lac-\n\nPhe and 1-carboxyethylphenylalanine standards by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). As shown in Fig. 1f, in mouse, human, and racehorse plasma, we detected a m/z =236.0928 peakeluting at ~12 min, which was an identical retention time to that of the Lac-Phe standard. By contrast, 1-carboxyethylphenylalanine eluted 5 min later at ~17 min. In fact, no endogenous peak at m/z =236.0928 and a 17 min retention time could be observed. On the basis of both MS/MS fragmentation and retention time, we conclude that the identity of the X-15497/1-carboxyethylphenylalanine/Lac-Phe metabolite is indeed Lac-Phe, and not 1-carboxyethylphenylalnine. In addition, our data demonstrate that 1-carboxyethylphenylalanine is not an endogenous metabolite.\n\n## SLC17 transporters ef /uniFB02 ux Lac-Phe in vitro\n\nHaving con rmed /uniFB01 the chemical structure for X-15497/1-carboxyethylphenylalanine as Lac-Phe, we next turned to the observed genetic association of urine Lac-Phe with the SLC17A1-4 locus. The lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs9461218, is located in an intronic region of the SLC17A1 geneandisassociated with a decrease in urine Lac-Phe levels ( \u03b2 =-0.242 + /- 0.023, P = 9.9e-26, non-effect allele G, effect allele A, effect allele frequency 0.22) 15 . However, the genetic association signal maps into an extended linkage disequilibrium block and encompasses the adjacent genes SLC17A2 , SLC17A3 , and SLC17A4 (Fig. 1c). No genetic association signal was detected between Lac-Phe levels in blood and the SLC17A1-4 locus 15 . A signi /uniFB01 cant correlation was detected between urine and plasmaLac-Phe levels (r = 0.54, P &lt; 2.2e-16, Supplementary Fig. 1). In the Type 2 Diabetes Knowledge Portal (T2D-KP), the SLC17A1-4 locus is signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with multiple cardiometabolic traits (Supplementary Fig. 2).\n\nThe SLC17A1-4 genes encode for four plasma membrane solute carriers, which are also called NPT1-4. SLC17A1-4 transporters were originally shown to be co-transporters of sodium and phosphate in vitro. Other additional in vitro transport substrates include urate and synthetic organic anions such as p-aminohippuric acid 16 -18 . Moreover, human genetic screens of entire plasma and urine metabolomes point towards dozens of putative additional physiological and xenobiotic substrates 15 . A biochemical interpretation of the genetic association between Lac-Phe and the SLC17A1-4 locus is that Lac-Phe is an endogenous substrate transported by SLC17 family members. To test this prediction, we obtained mammalian expression plasmids for each SLC17A1-4 and cDNAs were individually transfected into HEK293T cells. As an additional positive control, we also transfected ABCC5, a previously reported in vitro Lac-Phe transporter 12 . One day after transfection, cells were changed to serum free media and incubated for an additional 24 h. Media Lac-Phe levels were then measured by LC-MS (Fig. 2a). Compared to GFP-transfected controls, we observed a 2-fold and 5-fold increase in extracellular Lac-Phe in cells transfected with SLC17A1 and SLC17A3, respectively (Fig. 2b). By contrast, cells transfected with SLC17A2 and SLC17A4 did not exhibit any signi /uniFB01 cant increase in media Lac-Phe levels. ABCC5-tranfected cells also exhibited a ~ 2-fold increase in Lac-Phe. The mRNA expression for eachSLC17A1-4wascomparableasmeasuredbyqPCR(Supplementary Fig. 3a). Western blotting of transfected lysates with an anti/uniFB02 ag antibody con /uniFB01 rmed protein expression of SLC17A2-4, while protein levels of SLC17A1 were below the limit of detection (Supplementary Fig. 3b). We conclude that overexpression of SLC17A3, and to a lesser extent SLC17A1, is suf /uniFB01 cient to drive Lac-Phe ef /uniFB02 ux from cells.\n\nNext, we performed untargeted metabolomic comparisons of conditioned media from SLC17A1-transfected or SLC17A3-transfected cells compared to GFP controls. Using XCMS software 19 , we identi /uniFB01 eda total of N =13 and N =20 features that were signi /uniFB01 cantly increased ( P &lt;0.05) upon SLC17A1 or SLC17A3 transfection, respectively, compared to GFP control (Supplementary Data 1 and Fig. 2c, d). Notably, Lac-Phe was the top most increased metabolite in SLC17A1-transfected media, and it was the second most increased metabolite in SLC17A3-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nb\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n10\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1-carboxyethylphenylalanine\n\nC 12\n\nH 15\n\nNO4\n\n-\n\nm/z\n\n= 236.0928\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nf\n\nm/z\n\nFig. 1 | Structural assignment and association of X-15497/1-carboxyethylphenylalanine/Lac-Phe with the SLC17A1-4 locus in humans. a -c Manhattan plot displaying the -log10 (P-values) by chromosomal position ( a ), QQ plot displaying the expected -log10 (P-values) under the null vs. observed -log10 (P-values) ( b ), and regional association plot of the SLC17A1-4 locus on chromosome 6 ( c ) of the genetic association of the urine metabolite, X-15497/1-carboxyethylphenylalanine/N-lactoyl-phenylalanine (Lac-Phe). d Chemical structure of Lac-Phe (left) and 1-carboxyethylphenylalanine (right). e Tandem mass spectrometry fragmentation of an authentic Lac-Phe standard (top), an authentic\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntransfected media(Fig. 2c, d). These data demonstrate that amongst all detected metabolites, Lac-Phe is a principal transport substrate for SLC17A1 and SLC17A3.\n\nIf SLC17 transporters mediate ef /uniFB02 ux of Lac-Phe, then overexpression of both CNDP2 and SLC17 transporters should result in\n\neven greater levels of extracellular Lac-Phe because now both intracellular biosynthesis and plasma membrane ef /uniFB02 ux are increased. We therefore transfected CNDP2 alone or co-transfected CNDP2 with each individual SLC17 transporter. CNDP2 overexpression was con /uniFB01 rmedby Western blot (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Overexpression of CNDP2 alone\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCNDP2\n\ndid not alter media Lac-Phe levels, establishing that driving intracellular biosynthesis alone is not suf /uniFB01 cient to increase extracellular LacPhe levels. However, when CNDP2 was overexpressed with SLC17A1 or SLC17A3, we observed a dramatic 3-fold and 40-fold increase in extracellular Lac-Phe levels, respectively (Fig. 2e). We also observed a synergistic effect of overexpression of CNDP2 and SLC17A4: in this case, media Lac-Phe levels were increased by 6-fold, whereas no changes were observed with CNDP2 or SLC17A4 overexpression alone. Lastly, no increase in media Lac-Phe could be observed with SLC17A2. Quanti /uniFB01 cation of intracellular levels of phenylalanine and Lac-Phe did not reveal any major differences upon transfection by individual SLC17 family members alone or in combination with CNDP2; intracellular lactate was below the limit of detection of our method (Supplementary Fig. 3d -i). We also did not observe any evidence for Lac-Phe accumulating intracellularly upon CNDP2 overexpression alone, which potentially re /uniFB02 ects alternative pathways of intracellular Lac-Phe metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 3d -i). These data show that CNDP2 and SLC17 family members can cooperatively increase extracellular Lac-Phe levels.\n\nTo determine the generality of SLC17-mediated Lac-Phe ef /uniFB02 ux in non-renal cells, we also measured Lac-Phe levels in media after transfection of the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7. Overexpression of SLC17A2 and SLC17A3, but not SLC17A1 or SLC17A4, in RAW264.7 macrophages increased media Lac-Phe levels by ~50% (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Therefore, the magnitude of SLC17-mediated Lac-Phe ef /uniFB02 ux in cell culture is dependent both on the speci /uniFB01 c transporter and also the cell type.\n\nWe used cellular knockout studies to determine whether genetic ablation of SLC17 family members would reduce Lac-Phe ef /uniFB02 uxinvitro. HEK293Tcellsdo not express SLC17A proteins (Supplementary Fig. 3a, Ct &gt;30). We therefore turned to the mouse kidney epithelial TKPTS\n\ncells. By mRNA levels, only Slc17a1 was robustly expressed in this cell line while mRNA levels for Slc17a2 , Slc17a3 , and Slc17a4 were not detected (Supplementary Fig. 4b). In SLC17A1-KO TKPTS cells, media Lac-Phe levels were reduced by 40% compared to control TKPTS cells (Supplementary Fig. 4c), demonstrating that SLC17 family members are physiologic contributors to Lac-Phe ef /uniFB02 ux in vitro.\n\n## Urine Lac-Phe levels after sprint exercise\n\nNext, we examined the tissue mRNA expression pattern for SLC17A1-4 in both mice (using qPCR analysis of a tissue panel) and humans (using GTEx) 20 . In both species, SLC17A1/3, the two transporters with greatest cellular Lac-Phe ef /uniFB02 ux activities, were highly expressed in the kidney (Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary Fig. 5). On the other hand, human SLC17A2 was liver-speci /uniFB01 c and human SLC17A4 exhibited a broader tissue expression pattern (Supplementary Fig. 5). The public mouse gene expression portal BioGPS 21 also con /uniFB01 rmed restricted expression of Slc17a1/3 to the kidney (Supplementary Fig. 6). Lastly, within the kidney, the mouse single cell RNAseq dataset Tabula Muris showed high enrichment of Slc17a1/3 in epithelial cells of the proximal tubule, which, coincidentally, was also where high expression of Cndp2 mRNA was found (Supplementary Fig. 7). These expression data suggest that SLC17A1/3-dependent ef /uniFB02 ux of Lac-Phe may be most relevant for regulating urine levels of Lac-Phe.\n\nTo determine if urine Lac-Phe levels are dynamically regulated by exercise, we measured Lac-Phe beforeand after a Wingate sprint test in humans. In our previous Wingate test study , urine was not collected. 9 We therefore performed a new Wingate test in N =10 healthy volunteers and collected urine before and at 1 and 2 h after the test (Fig. 3c). This Wingate test consisted of three sets of sprinting (30 s each sprint) on a bicycle ergometer. We observed a wide range of basal urine LacPhe concentrations in humans (range: 0.5 -17 \u03bc M, average 4 \u03bc M). One\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFig. 3 | Lac-Phe levels increase in human urine after sprint exercise. mRNA expression levels of SLC17 family members across mouse ( a ) and human( b ) tissues.

In addition to Lac-Phe, we also measured urine levels of both lactate and urate. Urine lactate also exhibited similar kinetics to Lac-Phe, being dramatically induced by 1 h post-exercise and returning to baseline at the 2 h time point (Fig. 3f, g). Urine urate levels were unchanged throughout the protocol (Fig. 3h, i). We conclude that urine Lac-Phe levels exhibit dynamic regulation following sprint exercise.\n\n## Genetic ablation of SLC17A1/3 transporters reduces urine Lac-Phe levels\n\nTo directly test the in vivo contribution of SLC17 transporters to renal ef /uniFB02 ux of Lac-Phe in mice, we obtained knockout mice that are genetically de /uniFB01 cient in either SLC17A1 or SLC17A3. SLC17A1 and A3 were selected because these two transporters exhibited the most robust Lac-Phe ef /uniFB02 ux activity in cells (Fig. 2b) and also high expression in the kidney (Fig. 3a). While both SLC17A1-KO and SLC17A3-KO mice\n\nexercise. For d i -, subjects were 6 male, 4 female, age 28.3 \u00b1 5.3 (mean \u00b1 SD), N =10 biological replicates per group. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SD. P -values in d i -were calculated by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett T3 post-hoc tests. Source Data are provided as a Source Data File.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwere generated as part of the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) 22 , the biochemical, molecular, and physiologic phenotypes of these animals have not been previously reported.\n\nThe Slc17a1/3 genes are localized in very close proximity (&lt;20 kb) on mouse chromosome 13 (Fig. 4a). First, we characterized SLC17A1-KO mice, which were produced via CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of exon 3 (Fig. 4a). Complete loss of Slc17a1 mRNAwasobserved from kidneys of SLC17A1KO mice (Fig. 4b). The mRNA levels of Slc17a3 were not different, establishing speci /uniFB01 c deletion of only SLC17A1 in this genetic model (Fig. 4b). We were unable to robustly detect SLC17A1 protein by shotgun proteomics of whole kidney (Supplementary Data 2). In SLC17A1-KO mice, a ~30% reduction of urine Lac-Phe levels compared to WT littermates was observed (Fig. 4c); by contrast, the levels of other urine solutes, such as urate, were unchanged (Fig. 4d). In a separate cohort of mice, baseline plasma Lac-Phe were also unaltered in SLC17A1-KO mice (Fig. 4e). To determine if the baseline differences in urine Lac-Phe levels persisted upon exogenous Lac-Phe treatment, we administered Lac-Phe\n\nFig. 4 | Reduced urine Lac-Phe levels in SLC17A1- and SLC17A3-KO mice.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\na Schematic of the Slc17a1 and Slc17a3 genes on mouse chromosome 13 and the genetic modi /uniFB01 cations resulting in the SLC17A1-KO or SLC17A3-KO mouse. b mRNA levels of the indicated genes from kidneys of WT or SLC17A1-KO mice, N =4 biological replicates per group.

Under these conditions, urine Lac-Phe levels were dramatically elevated following the treatment but were not different in SLC17A1-KO mice (Fig. 4f).\n\nNext, we examined SLC17A3-KO mice. These animals harbor the so called tm2a KO /uniFB01 rst allele in which a splice acceptor and polyadenylation sequence are inserted in between exons 2 and 3. In kidneys from the SLC17A3-KO mice, Slc17a3 mRNA was completely absent (Fig. 4g). We also observed a ~60% partial reduction of Slc17a1 mRNA (Fig. 4g). Shotgun proteomics revealed complete loss of SLC17A3 protein in knockout mice (Supplementary Data 3). The partial reduction of Slc17a1 mRNA may re ect complex and long-range interactions of the tm2a /uniFB02 allele modi cation in the /uniFB01 Slc17a3 gene. In urine, Lac-Phe levels were reduced by 40% in SLC17A3-KO mice compared to WT controls (Fig. 4h) without any changes in urine urate levels (Fig. 4i). In a separate cohort of SLC17A3-KOmice,baseline plasma Lac-Phe levels were also not different (Fig. 4j). In addition, the lower Lac-Phe excretion of SLC17A3-KO mice persisted even with exogenous Lac-Phe administration (50 mg/kg, IP, Fig. 4k). Our efforts to obtain double SLC17A1/3-KO mice via breeding were unsuccessful, which likely re /uniFB02 ects the close physical proximity of these two alleles and consequently lack of independent recombination. Weconclude that both SLC17A1 and SLC17A3 are physiologic regulators of urine, but not plasma Lac-Phe levels. In addition, SLC17A1 and SLC17A3 appears to have differential contributions to the urine Lac-Phe pool, with SLC17A3 being the more dominant transporter, under conditions of elevated circulating Lac-Phe.\n\nAfter a single bout of treadmill exercise, mRNA levels of Slc17a1 and Slc17a3 were unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 8a). We were unable to collect urine after treadmill exercise in mice, likely because the mice had already voided their bladders during the treadmill activity. Immediately after a single bout of exhaustive treadmill exercise, plasma Lac-Phe levels were still not different in either SLC17A1-KO or SLC17A3-KO mice (Supplementary Fig. 8b, c).\n\nBoth SLC17A1-KO and SLC17A3-KO mice had normal kidney histology as assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b). In addition, plasma markers of renal function were unchanged in both genotypes (Supplementary Data 4 and Supplementary Data 5). A blood metabolic panel also did not reveal any differences in either SLC17A1-KO and SLC17A3-KO mice (Supplementary Data 4 and Supplementary Data 5). Body weights and food intake were also not different in SLC17A1-KO and SLC17A3-KO mice compared to WT controls on high fat diet (Supplementary Fig. 9c, d), consistent with an absence of changes in circulating Lac-Phe levels in these animals. Lastly, we subjected a cohort of SLC17A3-KO and WT mice to a combined high fat diet/treadmill exercise protocol, but also did not detect any genotype-dependent effects on body weight or food intake (Supplementary Fig. 9e).\n\nWe did not detect any differences in urine Lac-Phe in WT versus CNDP2-KO mice (Supplementary Fig. 10b).\n\n## Discussion\n\nHere we provide several independent lines of evidence to show that SLC17 family members are physiologic urine Lac-Phe transporters : 1 overexpression of SLC17A1 and SLC17A3 dramatically increases LacPhe levels in conditioned media of cultured cells, a biochemical effect that is synergistic with the Lac-Phe biosynthetic enzyme CNDP2 2 ; individual genetic ablation of SLC17A1 or SLC17A3 in mice reduces urine Lac-Phe levels; and 3 urine Lac-Phe levels exhibit strong genetic associations with the SLC17A1-4 locus in humans. These data establish physiologic plasma membrane transporters for Lac-Phe in vivo and uncover a molecular mechanism involved in the renal excretion of this signaling metabolite.\n\nPreviously, SLC17A1-4 family members have been characterized to be plasma membrane transporters involved in renal excretion of urate. Supporting this hypothesis, SLC17A1-4 transporters exhibit urate transport activity in vitro 18 and polymorphisms in the SLC17A1-4 locus are genetically associated with plasma urate levels in humans 23 . Our studies further build on these observations by demonstrating that LacPhe is also a physiologic substrate of SLC17A1/3 transporters. In addition, our untargeted metabolomics of cells transfected with SLC17A1-4 family members, as well as recent genome-wide association studies in humans, would also suggest that there are potentially many more physiologic SLC17A1-4 substrates beyond these alone 15 . The ability to form anions, which is a characteristic present in both Lac-Phe and other annotated SLC17A1-4 substrates (e.g., urate, p-aminohippuric acid, acetylsalicylic acid), appears to be a common feature shared amongstSLC17A1-4substrates.However, we note that one limitation in this study is that we have not provided direct evidence that Lac-Phe can be transported by SLC17A1/3 using reconstituted transport assays with puri /uniFB01 ed components. In the future, such studies would provide more de /uniFB01 nitive in vitro evidence for SLC17A1/3-mediated transport of the Lac-Phe metabolite.\n\nOur mouse knockout studies demonstrate that each SLC17A1 and SLC17A3 contribute to renal excretion of Lac-Phe. Notably, that only partial de /uniFB01 ciency of urine Lac-Phe is observed in each SLC17A1and SLC17A3-KO mice is consistent with functional redundancy between these two solute carriers. We did not observe changes in urine urate levels with individual genetic ablation of SLC17A1/3 which may be due to a contribution of ABCG2 as a urate transporter 24 and/ or the presence of uricase in mice which could catabolize excess urate to allantoin 25 . In the future, the generation of double SLC17A1/ 3-KO mice, or potentially mice de /uniFB01 cient in all four SLC17 transporters, may clarify whether there are additional, non-SLC17-dependent mechanisms for regulating urine Lac-Phe levels. In addition, kidneyspeci /uniFB01 c SLC17A1 or SLC17A3 knockout mice, once available, could also help to further re /uniFB01 ne the importance of the renal expression of these transporters. Selective and in vivo-active SLC17A1/3 inhibitors, once developed, may also enable pharmacological interrogation of this pathway. Beyond Lac-Phe, in humans many additional urine metabolites have been associated with the SLC17A1-4 locus, suggesting that these transporters have a large number of endogenous physiologic substrates.\n\nThe key insight that enabled identi /uniFB01 cation of SLC17 carriers as LacPhe transporters originated from correct determination of the chemical structure of ' X-15497/1-carboxyethylphenylalanine. ' The similarity in MS/MS between Lac-Phe and 1-carboxyethylphenylalanine, especially in the m/z = 88 daughter ion, likely contributed to the initially incorrect structure. This correction underscores the importance of generating chemical standards and using differential retention time for high con/uniFB01 dence structural assignment of metabolites. Our studies also enable the correct reinterpretation of ' 1-carboxyethylphenylalanine ' in other public metabolomic datasets as Lac-Phe 26 .\n\nWhile SLC17A1 and SLC17A3 transporters clearly mediated LacPhe excretion to urine, we were unable to detect changes in plasma Lac-Phe levels in the SLC17A1or SLC17A3-KO mice. Therefore, SLC17A1/3 transporters do not appear to substantially contribute to clearance of plasma Lac-Phe levels. One explanation for this observation is that SLC17A1/3 transporters are localized to the apical plasma membrane and face the urine, and consequently only in /uniFB02 uence LacPhe levels in this matrix 27,28 . Another possibility is that the Lac-Phe excreted in urine represents a small fraction of total Lac-Phe /uniFB02 ux in the circulation. Future work will be required to uncover the molecular identity of the Lac-Phe transporter that mediates its ef /uniFB02 uxfromitssites of production (e.g., CNDP2+ cells) to blood plasma. It seems plausible that different cell types might use different Lac-Phe transporters to ef /uniFB02 ux Lac-Phe into different body /uniFB02 uids. For instance, while ABCC5-KO mice do not have any differences in plasma Lac-Phe levels , it may be 9 possible that ABCC5 physiologically contributes to Lac-Phe ef /uniFB02 ux in another /uniFB02 uid (e.g., urine, cerebral spinal /uniFB02 uid). Whether Lac-Phe can be transported in or out of cells lacking CNDP2 and/or SLC17A1/3 also remains an important question for the future.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Cell line culture\n\nAll cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in an incubator at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. HEK293T and RAW264.7 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS and 2% penicillin-streptomycin. TKPTS cells were maintained in DMEM F-12 with 10% FBS and 2% penicillin-streptomycin.\n\n## General animal information\n\nAnimal experiments were conducted according to the Stanford University Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care approved protocols. Mice were maintained in 12-h light-dark cycles at 22 \u00b0C and 50% relative humidity. Unless otherwise indicated, mice were fed a standard irradiated rodent chow diet. The high-fat diet used was from Research Diets (D12492, 60% kcal from fat). SLC17A1 animals were obtained from the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC, C57BL/6NJSlc17a1em1(IMPC)J/Mmjax) and SLC17A3 animals were obtained from the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP, C57BL/6N-Slc17a3tm2a(KOMP) Wtsi/HMmucd, 049670-UCD). Sample sizes were determined on the basis of previous experiments using similar methodologies.\n\n## Chemicals\n\nN-Lactoyl Phenylalanine (catalogue # 318943) was purchased from NovoProLabsand1-Carboxyethylphenylalanine (ENAH95E73EBB) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich.\n\n## In vitro transporter assays\n\nHEK293T cells were plated in 10 cm plates at 5 million cells/plate and the next day transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids using PolyFect (Qiagen 301105) according to the manufacturer s instructions. RAW ' 264.7 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine LTX reagent with PLUS reagent according to manufacturer s instructions. One-day post-trans-' fection, cells were re-plated into 12-well plates at 70 -80%con uence.The /uniFB02 next day cells were put into 0.5 ml of serum free media. After overnight incubation, 400 \u03bc l of media was removed and 20 \u03bc l of 1 M hydrochloride addedtoacidifythemediaandprotonateLac-Phe.400 \u03bc l of ethyl acetate wasaddedintoeachsampleandvortexedfor30stoextractLac-Pheinto the organic layer. 300 \u03bc l from the top layer was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and dried down under a stream of nitrogen. The residue wasre-suspendedin100ulofan80:20mixtureofacetonitrile/water.The mixture was centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min at 21,000 \u00d7 g and the supernatant was transferred to a LC-MS vial. For collection of intracellular metabolites, cells were wash 2 times with PBS and lysed in 150 ul of a 2:1:1 acetonitrile:methanol:water mixture. The cells were scraped from the well and both cell lysate and supernatant were transferred to an Eppendorf tube. The samples were then centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min at 21,000\u00d7 g and the supernatant was transferred to LC-MS vials.\n\n## Untargeted measurements of metabolites by LC-MS\n\nUntargeted metabolomics measurements were performed on an Agilent 6520 Quadrupole Time-of-Flight (Q-TOF) LC/MS. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed using electrospray ionization (ESI) in negative mode. The dual ESI source parameters were set as follows, the gas temperaturewasset at 250 \u00b0C with a drying gas /uniFB02 owof12l/minand the nebulizer pressure at 20 psi. The capillary voltage was set to 3500 V and the fragmentor voltage set to 100 V. Separation of polar metabolites was conducted on a Luna 5 \u03bc mNH2 100\u00c5 LC column (Phenomenex 00B4378-E0) with normal phase chromatography. Mobile phases were as follows: Buffer A, 95:5 water/acetonitrile with 0.2% ammonium hydroxide and 10 mM ammonium acetate. Buffer B, acetonitrile. The LC gradient started at 100% B with a /uniFB02 ow rate of 0.2 ml/min from 0 to 2 min. The gradient was then increased linearly to 50% A/50% B at a /uniFB02 ow rate of 0.7 ml/min from 2 to 20 min. From 20 to 25 min the gradient was maintained at 50% A/50% B at a /uniFB02 ow rate of 0.7 ml/min. The number of biological replicates analyzed is indicated in the /uniFB01 gure legends and all samples were ran with one technical replicate. Data was analyzed using Agilent Qualitative Analysis (version B.07.00) by extracting for the indicated compounds at the exact mass +/ -20 ppm. XCMS analysis was performed by XCMS online.\n\n## Targeted measurements of Lac-Phe by LC-MS\n\nTargeted measurements were performed on an Agilent 6470 Triple Quadrupole (QQQ) LC/MS. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed using electrospray ionization (ESI) in negative mode. The AJS ESI source parameters were set as follows, the gas temperature was set at 250 \u00b0C with a gas /uniFB02 ow of 12l/min and the nebulizer pressure at 25 psi. The sheath gas temperature was set to 300 \u00b0C with the sheath gas /uniFB02 owset at 12 l/min. The capillary voltage was set to 3500 V. Separation of Lac-Phe was performed as described above in the untargeted metabolomics section. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was performed for Lac-Phe by looking at the precursor ion [ m/z ] -=236.1 transition to [ m/z ] -=88 product ion (unit mass). Dwell time was set to 50, fragmentor voltage wasset as 135 V, with collision energy of 10 V and cell accelerator voltage of 5 V. The number of biological replicates analyzed is indicated in the /uniFB01 gurelegendsandallsampleswereranwithonetechnicalreplicate.Data was analyzed using Agilent Qualitative Analysis (version B.07.00).\n\n## Generation of SLC17A1 KO TKPTS Cells\n\nThe plentiCRISPRv2 system developed by the Zhang lab was used to generate the SLC17A1-KO TKPTS cell line. The sgRNA used was 5 -' TGGGCACCTCCCTTAGAACG-3. Following Zhang lab protocols, oli-' gonucleotides for the sgRNA and reverse complement sequences were synthesized and cloned into the plentiCRISPRv2 vector. Lentivirus particles were generated in the HEK293T cell line using PEI for the cotransfection of the cloned plentiCRISPRv2 plasmid with the viral packing psPAX2 plasmid, and viral envelope pMD2.G plasmid. A noncutting plentiCRISPRv2 plasmid was used as a control. The lentivirus was harvested after 48 h and /uniFB01 ltered through a 0.45 uM /uniFB01 lter. The supernatant was then mixed in a 1 to 1 ratio with polybrene to a /uniFB01 nal concentration of 8 ug/ml polybrene. This mixture was added to TKPTS cells for transduction. Two days later, the cells were split into a 10 cm plate and underwent selection with 5 ug/ml puromycin for 3 -6 days.\n\n## Human exercise study\n\n10 healthy individuals, 6 male, 4 female, age 28 \u00b1 5 (mean \u00b1 SD), were enrolled and consented to participate in the exercise study approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board (IRB-65281). Participants arrived at the test facility and urine collected prior to exercise training. The participants then underwent a sprint exercise Wingate test. The Wingate test was conducted on an ergometer bike in which there was a 5 min warm-up followed by three bouts of 30 s alloutsprint interspersed by 4 min of active recovery. Urine samples were collected before and 1 and 2 h post-exercise for LC-MS analysis.\n\n## Mouse running protocols\n\nFor mouse running studies a 6 lane Columbus Instruments animal treadmill (product 1055-SRM-D65) was used. Mice were /uniFB01 rst acclimated to the treadmill for 5 min before the running protocol began. For acute, intense running experiments, the treadmill speed begun at 7.5 m/min at a 4\u00b0incline. Every 3 min, the speed and incline were increased by 2.5 m/min and 2\u00b0, respectively until a maximum speed of 40 m/min and incline of 30\u00b0 was reached. Mice were run on the treadmill until exhaustion which was de /uniFB01 ned as when mice remained on the shocker at the end of the treadmill for longer than 5 s. For chronic running experiments, mice were exercised 5 days/week (Monday-Friday). The mice were also kept on high fat diet (60% kcal from fat). The treadmill running was performed at a constant 5\u00b0 incline and began at a speed of 6 m/min. Speed was increased by 2 m/min every 5 min until a maximum speed of 30 m/min. Mice were once again stopped upon reaching exhaustion and run times were normalized between the two genotypes.\n\n## Preparation of plasma and urine samples for LC-MS analysis\n\nPlasma was collected from mice via a submandibular bleed into lithium heparin tubes (BD, 365985) and kept on ice. The blood was centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C at 2200 \u00d7 g . for 5 min to separate out the top plasma layer which can be frozen at -80\u00b0C. To collect urine, mice were scruffed over an eppendorf tube and gently stroked until they urinated; samples were also stored at -80\u00b0C. To extract polar metabolites for LC-MS analysis, 150 ul of a 2:1 mixture of acetonitrile:methanol was added to 50 ul of either plasma or urine. The mixture was centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C at 21,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min and the supernatant was transferred to a LC-MS vial.\n\n## Breeding and genotyping of SLC17A1 and SLC17A3 KO mice\n\nSLC17A1-KO and WT animals as well as SLC17A3-KO and WT animals were generated by heterozygous breeding crosses. Genotyping was performed as follows: Tail clippings were obtained from littermates and boiled for 30 min at 95 \u00b0C in 100 \u03bc l of 50 mM NaOH to extract genomic DNA. The solution was neutralized by adding 21 \u03bc l of 0.5 M Tris (pH 7.2). For SLC17A1 animals, PCR reactions were performed by using primers for either the Slc17a1 WT allele (forward, 5 -CAGTTC-' CAGGGTTCTGTTCC-3; reverse, 5 -GGTGACCCTGTGTTGTTCAC-3 ) or ' ' ' Slc17a1 mutant allele (forward, 5 -TGTGCAACTGTCAACCAGAGT-3 ; ' ' reverse, 5 -CCAGTCTAGTGAGTGCTGTCGTC-3 ). The Promega GoTaq ' ' master mix was used for the PCR reaction. Each 25 \u03bc l reaction consisted of 12.5 \u03bc l of the promega master mix (M7122), 2.5 \u03bc l of a 10 \u03bc M mixture of forward and reverse primers, 2 \u03bc l of genomic DNA, and 8 \u03bc l of ultrapure water. The thermocycling program on BioRad C1000 TouchThermoCyclerbeganwithaninitial1 min30sat98 \u00b0C,followed by cycles of 30 s at 98 \u00b0C, 30 s at 60 \u00b0C, and 30 s at 72 \u00b0C (30 cycles), followed by 5 min at 72 \u00b0C and /uniFB01 nally held at 4 \u00b0C. Samples were run on a 2% agarose gel with 0.2 mg/ml EtBr. WT alleles are expected to yield a PCR product 130 base pairs in size while KO alleles are expected to yield PCR products that are 150 base pairs in size. For SLC17A3 animals, PCR reactions were performed by using primers for either the Slc17A3 WT allele (forward, 5 -' TCAAATGAAAGTTTATCCTCAATGCCTG-3; ' reverse, 5 -' AGATATATAGAGCCTGTGTCCACTGG-3) or the PreCre ' allele (forward, 5 - GGGATCTCATGCTGGAGTTCTTCG-3 ; reverse, 5 -' ' ' AGATATATAGAGCCTGTGTCCACTGG-3).ThePromegaGoTaqmaster ' mix was used for the PCR reaction. Each 15 \u03bc l reaction consisted of 7.5 \u03bc l of the promega master mix (M7122), 0.45 \u03bc l of a 20 \u03bc Mmixture of forward and reverse primers, 1 \u03bc l of genomic DNA, and 6.05 \u03bc l of ultrapure water. The thermocycling program on BioRad C1000 Touch Thermo Cycler began with 5 min at 94 \u00b0C, followed by cycles of 15 s at 94\u00b0C, 30 s at 65 \u00b0C ( -1 \u00b0C/cycle), 40 s at 72 \u00b0C (10 cycles), followed by 15 s at 94 \u00b0C, 30 s at 55 \u00b0C, 40 s at 72 \u00b0C (30 cycles), and ending with 5 min at 72 \u00b0C and /uniFB01 nally held at 4 \u00b0C. Samples were run on a 2% agarose gel with 0.2 mg/ml EtBr. WT alleles are expected to yield a PCR product 348 base pairs in size while KO alleles are expected to yield PCR products that are 559 base pairs in size.\n\n## Shotgun proteomics\n\nSamples were reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 20 min at 55 degrees Celsius, cooled to room temperature and then alkylated with 30 mM acrylamide for 30 min. They were then acidi /uniFB01 ed to a pH ~1 with 2.6 ul of 27% phosphoric acid, dissolved in 165 uL of S-trap loading buffer (90% methanol/10% 1 M triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB)) and loaded onto S-trap microcolumns (Proti /uniFB01 , C02-micro-80). After loading, the samples were washed sequentially with 150 ul increments of 90% methanol/10% 100 mM TEAB, 90% methanol/10% 20 mM TEAB, and 90% methanol/10% 5 mM TEAB solutions, respectively. Samples weredigestedat47 \u00b0Cfortwohourswith600 ngofmassspectrometry grade Trypsin/LysC mix (Promega, V5113). The digested peptides were then eluted with two 35 \u00b5 l increments of 0.2% formic acid in water and two more 40uL increments of 80% acetonitrile with 0.2% formic acid in water. The four elutions were consolidated in 1.5 ml S-trap recovery tubes and dried via SpeedVac (Thermo Scienti /uniFB01 c, San Jose CA). Finally, the dried peptides were reconstituted in 2% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid in water for LC-MS analysis.\n\nMass spectrometry experiments were performed using an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Scienti /uniFB01 c, San Jose, CA) attached to an Acquity M-Class UPLC system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). The UPLC system was set to a /uniFB02 ow rate of 300 nl/min, where mobile phase A was 0.2% formic acid in water and mobile phase B was 0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile. The analytical column was prepared inhouse with an I.D. of 100 microns pulled to a nanospray emitter using a P2000 laser puller (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). The column was packed with Dr. Maisch 1.9 micron C18 stationary phase to a length of approximately 25 cm. Peptides were directly injected onto the column with a gradient of 3 -45%mobilephaseB,followedbyahigh-Bwashovera total of 80 min. The mass spectrometerwasoperatedinadata-dependent mode using HCD fragmentation for MS/MS spectra generation.\n\nRAW data were analyzed using Byonic v4.4.1 (Protein Metrics, Cupertino, CA) to identify peptides and infer proteins. A concatenated FASTA /uniFB01 le containing Uniprot Mus musculus proteins and other likely contaminants and impurities was used to generate an in silico peptide library. Proteolysis with Trypsin/LysC was assumed to be semi-speci /uniFB01 c allowing for N-ragged cleavage with up to two missed cleavage sites. Both precursor and fragment mass accuracies were held within 12 ppm. Cysteine modi /uniFB01 ed with propionamide was set as a /uniFB01 xed modi /uniFB01 cation in the search. Variable modi /uniFB01 cations included oxidation on methionine, histidine and tryptophan, dioxidation on methionine and tryptophan, deamidation on glutamine and asparagine, and acetylation on protein N-terminus. Proteins were held to a false discovery rate of 1% using standard reverse-decoy technique.\n\n## Lac-Phe administration\n\nWT, SLC17A1-KO, or SLC17A3-KO mice were intraperitoneally injected with Lac-Phe at 50 mg/kg. Lac-Phe was dissolved in 18:1:1 (by volume) of saline:DMSO:Kolliphor EL and injected at 5 \u03bc l/g body weight. 30 min after Lac-Phe injection, urine was collected from mice and prepared for LC-MS analysis.\n\n## Statistics\n\nAll data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD or SEM as indicated in the legends. A student s two-sided t-test was used for pair-wise comparisons. For ' comparisons of multiple groups, P -values were calculated by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett T3 post-hoc tests. Unless otherwise speci /uniFB01 ed, statistical signi /uniFB01 cance was set as P &lt;0.05.\n\n## Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAll data generated or analyzed during this study are included within the published articles and its supplementary information.

Choline has important physiological functions as a building block for essential cell components and signaling molecules. Choline is a water-soluble charged molecule and, therefore, requires transport proteins to cross biological membranes. How it gets into cellular compartments, like mitochondria, has been poorly understood. This study shows that SLC25A48 transports choline into mitochondria. Mutations in SLC25A48 disrupt choline transport into mitochondria, leading to higher levels of choline in urine and blood in humans. These /uniFB01 ndings shed light on how choline is handled within cells and could have implications for understanding and treating conditions related to choline metabolism.\n\nM embrane transport proteins play a crucial role in the movement of ions and metabolites across biological membranes. Their proper functioning is essential for many physiological processes. Despite signi /uniFB01 cant progress in our understanding of these proteins, a substantial number of them remain uncharacterized, often referred to as orphan membrane transport proteins. 1 Deorphanization efforts are essential to unveil the hidden cellular functions and roles of these proteins in health and disease. Recent large-scale genomewide association studies of metabolite levels provide links between common genetic variants in membrane transporterencoding genes and metabolite levels. 2,3 This generates testable hypotheses to identify the physiological substrates of established and orphan human transport proteins in vivo .\n\nCholine is an essential nutrient with important roles in a variety of physiological processes and metabolic pathways. It is an essential component of phospholipids in cell membranes, such as phosphatidylcholines, a precursor of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and of the osmoregulatory betaine, and an important player in lipid metabolism. 4 Recent studies have uncovered a growing body of evidence linking choline to various diseases, such as neurologic disorders, metabolic syndromes, and liver disease. 4 Several choline transport proteins have been identi /uniFB01 ed and characterized in model systems, including SLC5A7, SLC44A1, SLC44A2, SLC44A4, SLC49A1, and SLC49A2. 5 -10 However, it is unclear which transporters affect systemic levels of free choline in humans and if they are linked to human genetic variation.\n\n## METHODS\n\n## Molecular biology\n\npDONR221\\_SLC25A48 was a kind gift from the RESOLUTE Consortium (Addgene plasmid number 131995; http://n2t. net/addgene:131995; research resource identi /uniFB01 er [RRID]: Addgene\\_131995). The SLC25A48 transcript was ligated into the pcDNA6. /uniFB02 ag vector, and mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (see Supplementary Methods for details).\n\n## Cell culture\n\nHEK293T and HeLa cell lines were cultured as described previously. 11 HEK293T cells were transfected with the calcium phosphate method, and HeLa cells with FuGENE HD (Promega E2311).\n\n## Protein isolation, gel electrophoresis, and Western blot analysis\n\nProteins were isolated, separated using sodium dodecylsulfate -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to polyvinylidene di /uniFB02 uoride membranes, as described previously. 12 Antibodies were anti-Flag (Sigma Aldrich F3165) and \u00df-actin (Sigma Aldrich A1978). Chemiluminescence signals were captured with the Intas ChemoCam system. Western blot analyses are representative of 3 experiments with similar results (Supplementary Methods).\n\n## Immuno uorescence /uniFB02\n\nHeLa cells were prepared for indirect immuno /uniFB02 uorescence, as described in the Supplementary Methods. Confocal imaging was conducted on a Zeiss LSM980 MP AiryScan 2 microscope with a 63 /C2 objective. Quantitative colocalization analysis was performed with the Colocalization plugin in the Zeiss ZEN blue 3.4 software (Supplementary Methods).\n\n## Mitochondrial isolation\n\nHEK293T cells were grown and transfected in 500-cm 2 plates. Two days after transfection, cells were harvested and mitochondrial pellets were obtained. 13 Mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in a mitochondrial uptake buffer (KCl, 120 mM; sucrose, 25 mM; N -2-hydroxyethylpiperazineN 0 -2-ethanesulfonic acid, 10 mM; ethyleneglycol-bis-[ b - aminoethylether]N N,N ,N , 0 0 -tetraacetic acid, 1 mM; KH2PO4, 1 mM; MgCl2, 5 mM; glutamate, 15 mM; and malate, 7.5 mM, adjusted to a pH 7.2) 6 (see Supplementary Methods).\n\n## 3 H choline transport studies\n\nA total of 25 m g of mitochondria was suspended in 50 m l mitochondrial uptake buffer with subsequent addition of 2 /C2 choline buffer (mitochondrial uptake buffer supplemented with 20 m M choline chloride and 10 nM choline chloride [methyl-3H]) and incubated for 5 minutes. Samples were washed twice with ice-cold mitochondria washing buffer (mitochondrial uptake buffer with 20 m M choline chloride), and the pellet was resuspended in Ultima Gold scintillation cocktail for quanti /uniFB01 cation of 3H-choline content using liquid scintillation counting.\n\n## Statistical analysis\n\nGraphPad Prism 9.5.1 software was used to graph, analyze, and present the obtained data. All results are expressed as mean /C6 SEM. All experiments were independently performed at least 3 times. A 2-tailed Mann-Whitney test was used to calculate P values when the sample size (biological replicates) was at least 10, and an unpaired t -test was used when the sample size was &lt; 10. P &lt; 0.05 was considered signi /uniFB01 cant.\n\n## Study population, choline measurements, and whole-exome sequencing\n\nGenetic associations with plasma and urine choline levels, measured as part of the Metabolon HD4 Global Discovery metabolomics panel, were evaluated in the German Chronic Kidney Disease study. 14 The SLC25A48 gene was investigated using whole-exome sequencing data. Details about the study sample, choline measurements, and whole-exome sequencing (sequencing, alignment, and variant calling) are found in the Supplementary Methods.\n\n## Variant annotation and rare variant testing\n\nCalled variants were annotated using Variant Effect Predictor version 109, incorporating various tools to predict deleteriousness. 15 -17 Loss-of-function variants for SLC25A48 were evaluated using the LoFtee Variant Effect Predictor plugin. 18 Two masks (\"LoF\\_mis\" and \"HI\\_mis\") that included rare variants (minor allele frequency &lt; 1%) were generated for variant aggregation testing. The LoF\\_mis mask included highcon /uniFB01 dence loss-of-function variants, missense variants with a MetaSVM score &gt; 0, or in-frame nonsynonymous variants with a fathmm-XF-coding score &gt; 0.5, whereas the HI\\_mis mask encompassed variants with high-impact consequences or missense variants meeting speci /uniFB01 c criteria. Burden tests, adjusting for covariates, were performed using the seqMeta Rpackage version 1.6.7. Statistical signi /uniFB01 cance was de /uniFB01 ned as P &lt; 0.05. Single-variant, covariate-adjusted association tests were conducted under additive modeling. Results are presented for the HI\\_mis mask, which yielded lower association P values. Further details are presented in the Supplementary Methods.\n\nFigure 1 | SLC25A48 is a human mitochondrial choline transporter.

To identify potential homologous proteins with experimental structures available, a sequencebased BLAST search of the Protein Data Bank as well as a structural homology based search using -the DALI Server 20 were performed. Details about the structures of other SLC25 family members, how they were superimposed, and how the matrix-open structure was modeled can be found in the Supplementary Methods. Figures were prepared using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC.\n\nWe previously found through genome-wide association studies of metabolite levels that common SLC25A48 variants are associated with altered choline levels in urine (Figure 1a), 2 and now established that the genetic basis of this association is shared with plasma choline as well as SLC25A48 transcript levels in brain tissue (Supplementary Figure S1), supporting the hypothesis that the orphan solute carrier SLC25A48 may be a choline transporter. SLC25A48 transcript levels are highest in brain and kidney. Within the kidney, expression is high in epithelial cells of the S3 segment of the proximal tubule, a cell type rich in mitochondria with diverse energydemanding functions such as bulk reabsorption of /uniFB01 ltered solutes (Supplementary Figure S2). Overexpressed SLC25A48 localized to mitochondria in human epithelial cells (Figure 1b; Supplementary Figures S3 and S4). We, therefore, isolated mitochondria of cells overexpressing SLC25A48 and measured mitochondrial uptake of radiolabeled choline (Figure 1c). Mitochondria from cells overexpressing SLC25A48 showed a signi /uniFB01 cant increase of choline uptake compared with mitochondria from control cells (Figure 1d).\n\nFigure 2 | Rare damaging variants in SLC25A48 impair choline transport.

Mitochondrial uptake of choline was time and concentration dependent (Figure 1e and f). These data support the hypothesis that SLC25A48 is a newly\n\nidenti /uniFB01 ed, high-af /uniFB01 nity mitochondrial choline transporter. SLC25A48 transports choline at nanomolar concentrations (Figure 1f), and thus operates at physiological concentrations of free choline in humans (7 -20 m M). 21\n\nTo test whether there is a causal link between altered choline levels in humans and impaired mitochondrial choline transport, we investigated the aggregated impact of rare, putatively damaging variants in SLC25A48 and found signi /uniFB01 cant associations with urine and plasma choline levels (burden test P \u00bc 1.4 /C2 10 -17 and 4.2 /C2 10 -06 , respectively; Supplementary Table 1). Carriers of driver variants (Supplementary Methods) showed signi /uniFB01 cantly higher levels of choline compared with noncarriers, which was more pronounced in urine than in plasma (Figure 2a). Identi /uniFB01 ed driver variants mapped into different regions of SLC25A48 (Figure 2b). The association with choline was speci /uniFB01 c: no metabolite other than choline showed signi /uniFB01 cant genetic associations after correcting for multiple testing (Supplementary Figure S6).\n\nCholine has been implicated in various human conditions, ranging from neurologic diseases to metabolic traits, but there is limited evidence linking genetic defects in choline transport to human disease. We, therefore, tested whether cholinerelated, putative loss-of-function mutations in SLC25A48 were associated with any of the human traits and diseases ascertained in the UK Biobank that are related to tissues where SLC25A48 is highly expressed (METHODS). None of the binary (Supplementary Table 2) or quantitative (Supplementary Table 3) traits was signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with SLC25A48 putative loss-of-function carrier status after correction for multiple testing.\n\nTo investigate whether implicated variants were causally related to altered choline levels, we generated 4 mutations in the SLC25A48 cDNA using site-directed mutagenesis and overexpressed these variants in human cell lines to study their effect on protein expression, localization, and function. Western blot analyses showed reduced protein expression of some, but not all, investigated SLC25A48 mutations compared with wild-type protein (Figure 2c). Interestingly, some mutations showed mislocalization from mitochondria (p.R179P and p.R243*), with a signi /uniFB01 cant reduction of the mitochondrial colocalization index compared with wild-type SLC25A48 (Figure 2d and e; Supplementary Figure S7), whereas other mutations localized to mitochondria like wild-type transporters (p.D27G and p.R64L; Supplementary Figure S7). These data show that only some of the investigated SLC25A48 mutations result in reduced protein expression and/or mislocalization.\n\nWe subsequently measured choline uptake in mitochondria to investigate which mutations affect SLC25A48 transport function. Despite differences in abundance and localization, all tested SLC25A48 mutations signi /uniFB01 cantly impaired mitochondrial choline uptake (Figure 2f). These data suggest that impaired mitochondrial choline transport via SLC25A48 results in altered plasma and urine choline levels in humans. This notion is supported by the increased cytosolic concentration of choline in SLC25A48-de /uniFB01 cient cells\n\n(Supplementary Figure S5), which decreases the driving force for choline into cells via plasma membrane choline transporters. From a mechanistic standpoint, our data suggest that the investigated mutations cause loss-of-function through different pathogenic mechanisms, including reduced expression, mislocalization, and impaired substrate turnover with normal expression level and localization.\n\nTo gain a better mechanistic understanding of why speci /uniFB01 c mutations cause impaired transport, we analyzed structural models of SLC25A48 in 2 conformations (Figure 2g; Supplementary Figure S8). The SLC25A48 models were in good agreement with experimental structures of other SLC25 family members, such as the adenosine diphosphate/adenosine triphosphate carrier and mitochondrial uncoupling protein (Supplementary Figure S8). Notably, residue D27 is part of a matrix-salt-bridge network of conserved residues, which is a key component of the matrix gate of these transporters and, thus, essential for transport function. This is in line with the strongly impaired choline transport of p.D27G despite its normal localization. 22,23 The other mutations were also localized on the matrix side of the transporter and may affect its folding and stability. A limitation of this study is the lack of proteoliposome experiments with puri /uniFB01 ed SLC25A48. Future studies investigating SLC25A48 in proteoliposomes may provide deeper insights into the biophysical properties, the structure, and the function of this mitochondrial transporter.\n\nIn summary, we show that the physiological function of SLC25A48 in humans is choline import into mitochondria. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC25A48 impair choline transport into mitochondria and cause higher levels of free choline in urine and plasma. The deorphanization of SLC25A48 de /uniFB01 nes its molecular function in humans and enables future well-powered studies addressing its role in health and disease.\n\n## DISCLOSURE\n\nAll the authors declared no competing interests.\n\n## DATA STATEMENT\n\nAll data generated or analyzed in this study were included in the main text and the Supplementary Material for this article.

We explored metabolites in plasma and urine for their association with unfavorable kidney outcomes or death in persons with CKD. Metabolomic analyses revealed 182 metabolites significantly associated with CKD progression or death. Many of these associations confirmed previously reported findings or were validated by analysis in an external study population. Our comprehensive screen of the metabolome serves as a valuable foundation for future investigations into biomarkers associated with CKD progression.\n\ncharacterized as laboratory measurement techniques are refined, 24 warranting further epidemiologic research even within the same study population. Within the GCKD study cohort, we quantified levels of the plasma metabolome. Additional follow-up data also became available, enabling the study of the first 6 years of follow-up. The extension in follow-up led to a doubling in the number of observed events for KF and deaths, thereby increasing the power of the study to detect associations of metabolites with KF or death. The general objective of this exploratory study was to identify new metabolic risk factors associated with KF and an additional composite kidney end point (CKE) as well as death. The specific aims were to (1) evaluate the robustness of previously reported results on KF and death and urine metabolites, (2) identify previously unreported urine or plasma metabolites that are associated with all 3 end points exploratively, and (3) systematically compare association results across matrices.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Study and Participants\n\nThe GCKD study is an ongoing prospective cohort study of persons with CKD under nephrological care. 22 The major inclusion criteria were an eGFR (1) between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or (2) &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in combination with overt albuminuria/proteinuria. In total, 5,217 adults were enrolled from 2010 to 2012. All participants provided informed consent. The GCKD study was approved by the local ethics committees of the participating centers (Item S1) and is registered in the German national registry for clinical studies (DRKS 00003971).\n\nA comprehensive description of available demographic and clinical data and description of the study population can be found elsewhere. 25 At baseline, biospecimens were collected and transported frozen to a central laboratory for routine clinical chemistry analyses of a core set of parameters (eg, creatinine; finished in 2013) and to a central biobank for storage in accordance with standard operating procedures. 26\n\n## Baseline Measurements and Data\n\nBaseline spot urine (3 batches, 2016-2017) and plasma (1 batch, 2020) samples were used to quantify metabolite concentrations using nontargeted mass spectrometry analysis at Metabolon Inc (Durham, NC). Details on sample preparation, identification, and quality control are provided in Item S2. Of note, urine metabolites were identified at the time of assessment in plasma again to align the metabolite identification and annotation in the continuously curated reference library. The final datasets contain semiquantitative measurements of 1,513 urine metabolites in 5,088 GCKD participants (97.5%) and 1,416 plasma metabolites in 5,144 GCKD participants (98.6%; Fig 1). Figure S1 shows heat maps of pairwise Spearman correlations of all metabolites per matrix. Creatinine at baseline measured by a routine enzymatic assay and measured by Metabolon, respectively, show an excellent correlation (Spearman correlation coefficients r of 0.93 in serum/plasma and 0.95 in urine).\n\nTo adjust for confounding, additional baseline variables were selected based on an extensive literature review and biological reasoning (Item S3). Glomerular filtration rate was estimated using the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) formula based on baseline serum creatinine. 27\n\n## Prospective Data and Outcomes\n\nIn the course of follow-up, hospital discharge letters, nephrologist outpatient letters, and death certificates are obtained, based on which clinical end points are adjudicated by an expert team using a distinct end point catalogue. Although follow-up is still ongoing, follow-up data until 6.5 years after study entry are available for analysis (data freeze, March 31, 2021).\n\nOutcomes in this project are KF defined by kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplant) or death due to untreated KF, and the CKE was defined as a composite end point of KF, an eGFR &lt; 15 mL/min/ 1.73 m 2 or eGFR decreased by 40% since baseline based on estimated eGFR slopes. For KF and the CKE, death from any cause other than related to KF or the CKE, respectively, was considered as the competing event. Death from any cause was also considered as a separate end point.\n\n## Statistical Analysis\n\nAs before, 23 a discovery -replication (2:1) design using a random split was chosen to provide internally validated results (Fig 1). In the main analysis, proportional hazards models were fitted to evaluate levels of each metabolite separately with prospective end points of KF and the CKE as well as death based on the complete data requested in the respective analysis. 28 Time was defined from study entry to the respective (first) event.\n\nFigure 1. Main work /uniFB02 ow and overview of results. CKE, composite kidney end point; GCKD, German Chronic Kidney Disease; KF, kidney failure.*Overlap in participants, n = 5,023; overlap in metabolites, n = 853. Missing levels of metabolites were not imputed for the analysis in this project. y Study sets were randomly split into discovery and replication sets (2:1). Complete case analyses (ie, participants without the respective metabolite measurement or incomplete data of adjustment variables were excluded). Models were /uniFB01 tted only when at least 30 events were available in the respective analysis. z For kidney failure, 30 unique metabolites were identi /uniFB01 ed: both matrices, n = 1; urine only, n = 4; plasma only, n = 25. x For the composite kidney end point, 49 unique metabolites were identi /uniFB01 ed: both matrices, n = 4; urine only, n = 9; plasma only, n = 36. { For death, 163 unique metabolites were identi /uniFB01 ed: both matrices, n = 105; urine only, n = 17; plasma only, n = 41.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor death, standard proportional hazards models were fitted, and the association of the metabolite is expressed as a hazard ratio (HR). For KF and the CKE, cause-specific proportional hazards models were fitted for the event of interest and the competing event, resulting in causespecific HRs. 29 To assess indirect effects of the competing event, subdistribution hazard regression models expressed in subdistribution HRs for KF and the CKE were fitted. 30,31 As a result of the standardization of metabolite levels (mean, 0; standard deviation, 1), any HR can be uniformly interpreted per 1 standard -deviation increase. We adjusted for baseline variables age, sex, eGFR, and log-transformed UACR (basic model) and additionally for an extended set of baseline variables: smoking, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, serum albumin level, C-reactive protein level, total cholesterol level, diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, and intake of loop diuretic agents (extended model; Item S3).\n\nModels of metabolites with fewer than 30 observed events in the discovery datasets were not evaluated to enforce a minimum of power in the discovery to detect associations. 32 For available models, a fixed-effects inverse variance -weighted meta-analysis was conducted to obtain an estimate across both datasets. If not stated otherwise, estimates from the meta-analysis model with basic adjustment are reported.\n\nWith respect to the basic model, an association was considered significant in the discovery stage if the P value of the metabolite's association was less than 0.05 divided by the number of metabolites assessed for the same matrix and end point (Fig 1). This association was then considered replicated if the metabolite's effect estimate in the replication was directionally consistent with the discovery stage and its association P value was less than 0.05 divided by the number of significant metabolites in the respective discovery analysis.\n\nDetails and information on sensitivity, subgroup and further downstream analyses, and validation of findings in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study are provided in Items S4 and S5.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Results\n\nWe performed an association screen of 1,513 urine and 1,416 plasma metabolite baseline levels with KF, the CKE, and death in more than 5,000 persons with CKD under nephrological care (Fig 1). The mean baseline eGFR was 49.5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in both analysis sets of 5,088 participants with urine measurements and 5,144 participants with plasma measurements (5,023 participants overlapped), and the respective median UACRs were 50.7 mg/g and 50.8 mg/g, in line with the complete GCKD cohort (Table 1).\n\nA total of 1,023 urine (67.6%) and 1,099 plasma (77.6%) metabolites were annotated to 8 superpathways (amino acid, energy, carbohydrate, nucleotide, cofactors and vitamins, lipid, peptide, and xenobiotics) and 118 (plasma) and 92 (urine) subpathways (Tables S1 and S2). The remainder was only partially characterized or yet unnamed at the time of this project. A total of 853 metabolites were measured in both urine and plasma.\n\nIn comparison with our previous project, 23 30 additional metabolites were identified and 4 yet unnamed or only partially characterized molecules were no longer reported, resulting in an overlap of 1,483 urine metabolites. The number of metabolite measurements per participant, as well as their levels, were perfectly aligned between projects except for one metabolite (metformin) for which the identification and quantification had been revised by Metabolon Inc in the mean time (Fig S2).\n\nDuring a median follow-up of 6.5 years (range, 0-6.5 years), 500 KF events (9.6%), 1,083 CKEs (20.8%), and 680 deaths (13%) were observed in 5,217 GCKD participants.\n\n## Associations of Metabolites With Outcomes\n\nWe identified 182 unique metabolites that were significantly associated with at least one end point, of which 30 were identified for KF, 49 for CKE, and 163 for death, respectively.\n\nThe replicated 30 KF metabolites were matrix-specific except for the unnamed metabolite X-12117 (urine only, n = 4; plasma only, n = 25; Tables S3 and S4). Among the 5 metabolites replicated in urine, the peptide \u03b3 -glutamylvaline showed a protective association (HR, 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.84), whereas the 4 others showed a harmful association (HR range, 1.17-1.41; Fig 2). In plasma, the lipid tricosanoyl sphingomyelin (d18:1/ 23:0)* and the unnamed metabolite X-11372 showed a protective association (HR range, 0.72-0.78), whereas 24 metabolites exhibited a harmful one (HR range, 1.291.95), with hydroxyasparagine having the highest HR (HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.68-2.25). The association of the matrix-shared metabolite X-12117 was harmful in plasma and in urine.\n\nFor CKE, 45 (urine only, n = 9; plasma only, n = 36) of 49 replicated metabolites were matrix-specific (Tables S5 and S6). Across matrices, 5 associations were protective\n\n(HR range, 0.77-0.83) and the others were harmful (HR range, 1.15-1.80; Fig 2). Three of 13 urine metabolites and 21 of 40 plasma metabolites associated with CKE were also associated with KF (Table S7). Although directionally consistent, the HRs for the CKE were often attenuated. Among them, plasma hydroxyasparagine had the highest HR (HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.63-1.98).\n\nFor death, 14 of the 163 metabolites were replicated in both matrices, 30 in urine only, and 119 in plasma only (Tables S8 and S9). Of the 44 metabolites replicated in urine, 17 showed a protective association (HR range, 0.67-0.82) and 27 showed a harmful association (HR range, 1.281.84). The strongest association was observed for X-12117 (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.67-2.03). In plasma, 34 showed a protective association (HR range, 0.67-0.80) and 99 a harmful one (HR range, 1.21-2.27). The 14 associations replicated in both matrices were all harmful in both matrices except for one, the amino acid N-acetylvaline, which was harmful in plasma (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.37-1.64) and protective in urine (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.68-0.79).\n\nOverall, one unnamed metabolite (X-12117) replicated in all 6 analyses and one (C-glycosyltryptophan) replicated in 5 of 6 (Fig 3). In total, we observed 20 plasma metabolites that replicated with all 3 end points (Table S7).\n\nAlthough estimated effect sizes were quite robust when adjusting for additional clinical variables (Item S2), estimated effect sizes between basic and extended adjustment models showed more differences for death than for KF, most likely because of the heterogeneity of the end point and the basic model lacking important factors for death (Fig S3). When comparing cause-specific and subdistribution HRs for KF and CKE (Fig S4), we found no evidence for indirect effects via the competing event.\n\n## Robustness of Association Results for Urine Metabolites\n\nThe estimated effect sizes showed a good correlation with those for urine metabolites evaluated in our previous project 23 (Spearman correlation coefficients: KF, r = 0.85; death, r = 0.94; Fig S5). Among the 8 previously reported associations with KF and 45 associations with death, 4 and 25 associations, respectively, replicated in the present project (Table S7). The remaining associations showed directionally consistent effect estimates but failed to pass the strict significance threshold and thus replication.\n\n## Overrepresentation of Subpathways\n\nAs in the previous project, 23 urine phosphatidylcholines (lipids) were significantly overrepresented among urine metabolites associated with KF ( P = 3.0 \u00d7 10 -4 ; Table S10). For CKE, urine metabolites of the phospholipid metabolism ( P = 1.6 \u00d7 10 -4 ) and plasma metabolites of the aminosugar metabolism ( P = 3.8 \u00d7 10 -4 ) were significantly overrepresented, whereas, for death, plasma sphingomyelins ( P = 3.7 \u00d7 10 -9 ) and metabolites of vitamin A metabolism ( P = 3.5 \u00d7 10 -5 ) were overrepresented.\n\nTable 1.

For 70 associations (88%), the direction of the effect estimate was consistent, and, for 23 of them, the P value reached statistical significance (Table S7). 33\n\n## Follow-up of Metabolites Associated With KF and CKE\n\nThe absolute values of Spearman correlation coefficients for the 54 plasma metabolites associated with KF or CKE ranged from 0.0 to 0.91 (median, 0.41), with a predominance of values greater than zero (83%; Table S11). The strongest positive pairwise correlation was observed\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 3. Intersection plot for the 182 metabolites signi /uniFB01 cant in at least 1 of the 6 analyses.

Urine metabolites (n = 49) were less correlated (absolute r : median, 0.13; range, 0.0-0.89).\n\nSubgroup analyses of the 56 unique metabolites whose levels in urine or plasma were associated with KF and the CKE (Item S4) yielded HR estimates concordant with the main analysis, showing little variation (Tables S12-S15).\n\n18 metabolites were lipids (n = 4), amino acids (n = 2), peptides (n = 2), xenobiotics (n = 2), and unnamed metabolites (n = 8). They include C-glycosyltryptophan, whose levels in blood but not urine had been repeatedly reported to associate with KF or related traits. Many of them showed moderate to good correlation with eGFR or UACR, the two major markers of kidney function and kidney injury, indicating their potential to explain the disease course beyond traditional biomarkers (Table 2).\n\nThe addition of these metabolites separately to a model aligned with the 4-variable KF risk equation (age, sex, eGFR, UACR) illustrates their potential to improve prediction of KF or CKE, warranting further research (Table S7). 6\n\nAll 56 metabolites were subjected to a literature search. For some of them (eg, pseudouridine), we found evidence for their association between the respective metabolite levels in the same matrix with CKD progression or related traits from studies other than the GCKD study (Table S7). For some associations of 18 metabolites, however, we found no evidence or weak evidence referring to a less related trait or to studies in nonhumans (Table 2). These\n\nExemplarily, the cumulative incidence functions for KF, CKE, and death per quartile of unnamed metabolite X12117 levels identified in all 6 analyses illustrate the positive association, regardless of whether the metabolite was measured in plasma or urine (Fig S6). Although the identity of this metabolite is still an open issue, plasma levels of this metabolite in our study correlated well with plasma nucleotide pseudouridine and the plasma amino acids C-glycosyltryptophan and hydroxyasparagine ( r &gt; 0.80). Published results indicate that this metabolite might be an amino acid. 34,35\n\nIn contrast to unnamed metabolites, literature on named metabolites from different research areas partially provides potential explanations for their association with\n\nTable 2.

The protective associations of \u03b3 -glutamylvaline levels in urine and plasma with KF, for example, is supported by its link to \u03b3 -glutamyltransferase (GGT1), an ectoenzyme that is highly expressed in the proximal tubule, and therefore the metabolite levels may represent a readout for its activity. 34,36\n\nIn summary, this screen gives a comprehensive overview of the connection of the human metabolome and KF, replicating previously known associations and identifying new promising candidates for follow-up studies to, for example, identify unnamed metabolites or address underlying (patho)physiologic mechanisms.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this comprehensive metabolome-wide association study of plasma and urine metabolites in a cohort of persons with CKD, we explored associations of their levels with KF, a CKE, and death to validate existing findings but also to detect novel ones. In total, we identified 182 unique metabolites associated with KF (n = 30), the CKE (n = 49), or death (n = 163). Despite a large overlap of metabolites measured in both matrices, the levels of only a few metabolites showed significant associations with the same end point in both matrices (Fig 3). This illustrates the usefulness of assessing metabolites from both urine and plasma to obtain a more comprehensive image of the connection between the metabolome and clinical outcomes. The absence of associations in one or the other matrix may give additional hints on the underlying mechanism, ie, metabolites solely identified in urine may provide a readout specific for kidney tubule function, and metabolites identified in only plasma may represent predominantly metabolites such as protein-bound lipids that do not pass the glomerular filter.\n\nComparing the present results with those of our previous project, 23 the gain in power to detect associations of metabolites with KF or death due to the increased number of observed events in the prolonged follow-up is obvious. Of the previously identified associations, &gt; 50% could be confirmed. Some associations were no longer statistically significant in the present project, possibly because these metabolites have only a short-term effect, in combination with the longer follow-up available in this project. The less pronounced but still directionally consistent effect sizes did not reach statistical significance when applying a strict replication threshold (Fig S5). In addition, we identified a series of associations within urine metabolites that had not been detected previously.\n\nIn light of the published literature, our results confirm reported associations but also uncover previously unreported findings. Among the previously reported metabolites associated with KF, some are known uremic solutes such as C-glycosyltryptophan or pseudouridine (Table S7). 37 The observed harmful associations of higher plasma levels of these metabolites with KF is therefore plausible. We observed the most harmful associations with\n\nKF and the CKE for plasma hydroxyasparagine, in line with previous reports. 38-40\n\nIn contrast, some associations with KF or the CKE for the 18 metabolites listed in Table 2 have not been reported in the literature to date. Still, available literature can hint at a potential link to CKD, as is the case for \u03b3 -glutamylvaline and its potential to represent a readout of the activity of the ectoenzyme GGT1. 34,36 Regarding lipid associations not reported before, there is literature discussing dysregulation of lipids and its connection with kidney function and disease. 41,42 For those metabolites of unknown identity, we cannot exclude that they might be identical to metabolites already reported to associate with CKD progression under a different name. The unnamed metabolite X12117, identified in all of our association analyses, likely is an amino acid. 34,35 Because of its high correlation with, for example, C-glycosyltryptophan in our data, it might represent a metabolite belonging to the tryptophan pathway, whose metabolites were repeatedly reported to be associated with CKD or CKD progression. 43\n\nOverall, the majority of metabolites associated with multiple end points or in both matrices showed consistent harmful associations (Fig 2). One exception is N-acetylvaline, which showed a harmful association with death and CKE in plasma and a protective one with death in urine. In line with our results, higher serum levels of N-acetylvaline have been reported to be associated with death. 44 For CKD progression, Luo et al. reported on the associations of selected N-acetylated amino acids. 45 Although N-acetylvaline was not included in their analysis, the observed associations of higher serum levels of N-acetyl amino acids with an increased risk for CKD progression indirectly support our results. Furthermore, the presumed role of N-acetylation in detoxification through improvement of the water-solubility of molecules, facilitating their secretion/excretion via the liver or kidney, also supports our finding of higher levels in urine and reduced risk of death. 46\n\nThe present project has several strengths, including the use of data obtained from a large cohort of wellcharacterized persons with CKD under nephrological care. In addition to the detailed characteristics from each GCKD participant and long follow-up data, metabolite measurements from plasma and urine using the same measurement technique were available for simultaneous assessment. Identified, internally validated associations could be externally evaluated in the ARIC study to a reasonable extent. Limitations of this project include the inherent issues of any observational study, especially in regard to confounding bias, and metabolite measurements of a semiquantitative nature (ie, no absolute quantification of levels, limiting comparison across studies) and their measurements at a single time point. Metabolite measurements therefore represent only a one-time snapshot of the metabolome, which otherwise may change over time. Although the measurement technique used provides comprehensive coverage of the metabolomes of plasma and urine, some mass spectrometric features still await\n\nmetabolic assignment, which is required to yield biologic insight. External validation in the ARIC study was limited because of differences in study design (eg, populationbased vs diseased cohort) and sample size.\n\nIn summary, the present study provides a comprehensive screen of associations between metabolite levels and KF, a CKE, or death in persons with CKD. It confirmed previously reported associations but also reported several findings not known before that warrant further research, eg, the identification of unnamed metabolites or an evaluation of causality. It further supports the reanalysis of existing study populations as more comprehensive readouts of the human metabolome become available.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\n## Supplementary File 1 (PDF)\n\nFigure S1: Matrix-speci /uniFB01 c heat maps for all evaluated metabolites in the GCKD study.\n\nFigure S2: Comparison of the number and median levels of measurements per urine metabolite available in previous and current analyses.\n\nFigure S3: Comparison of estimated effect sizes after basic and extended adjustment per matrix and event of interest.\n\nFigure S4: Comparison of estimated effect sizes obtained in the analyses of kidney failure using cause-speci /uniFB01 c and subdistribution hazard regression.\n\nFigure S5: Comparison of estimated effect sizes obtained in respective analyses of the previous and current projects.\n\nFigure S6: Cumulative incidence function for kidney failure, composite kidney end point, and death per quartile of X-12117 levels in urine and plasma.\n\nItem S1: List of GCKD study participating institutions and investigators\n\nItem S2: Urine and plasma metabolite measurements in the GCKD study\n\nItem S3: List and de nitions /uniFB01 of baseline variables in the GCKD study\n\nItem S4: Additional analyses of GCKD data\n\nItem S5: Validation of /uniFB01 ndings in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study\n\n## Supplementary File 2 (xlsx)\n\nTable S1: Annotation of evaluated urine metabolites\n\nTable S2: Annotation of evaluated plasma metabolites\n\nTable S3: Association results of metabolite levels in urine with kidney failure: basic model\n\nTable S4: Association results of metabolite levels in plasma with kidney failure: basic model\n\nTable S5: Association results of metabolite levels in urine with composite kidney end point: basic model\n\nTable S6: Association results of metabolite levels in plasma with composite kidney end point: basic model\n\nTable S7: Replicated association results of metabolite levels in urine or plasma with kidney failure and composite kidney end point\n\nTable S8: Association results of metabolite levels in urine with death: basic model\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable S9: Association results of metabolite levels in plasma with death: basic model\n\nTable S10: Results of overrepresentation test\n\nTable S11: Matrix-speci /uniFB01 c Spearman correlation matrices for the metabolites associated with kidney failure or composite kidney end point\n\nTable S12: Subgroup analysis: association results of meta-analysis of metabolite levels in urine with kidney failure (basic model)\n\nTable S13: Subgroup analysis: association results of meta-analysis of metabolite levels in plasma with kidney failure (basic model)\n\nTable S14: Subgroup analysis: association results of meta-analysis of metabolite levels in urine with composite kidney end point (basic model)\n\nTable S15: Subgroup analysis: association results of meta-analysis of metabolite levels in plasma with composite kidney end point (basic model)\n\nTable S16: Association results of metabolite levels in urine with kidney failure: extended model\n\nTable S17: Association results of metabolite levels in plasma with kidney failure: extended model\n\nTable S18: Association results of metabolite levels in urine with composite kidney end point: extended model\n\nTable S19: Association results of metabolite levels in plasma with composite kidney end point: extended model\n\nTable S20: Association results of metabolite levels in urine with death: extended model\n\nTable S21: Association results of metabolite levels in plasma with death: extended model\n\n## Article Information\n\nAuthors ' Full Names and Academic Degrees: Inga Steinbrenner, MSc, Ulla T.

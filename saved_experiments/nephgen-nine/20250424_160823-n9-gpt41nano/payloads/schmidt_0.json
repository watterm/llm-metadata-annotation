Acute tubular ' injury (ATI) is observed across various types of kidney diseases and may signi /uniFB01 cantly contribute to progression to kidney failure. Non-invasive biomarkers of ATI may allow for early detection and drug development. Using the SomaScanproteomics platform on 434 patients with biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmedkidney disease, we here identify plasma biomarkers associated with ATI severity. We employ regional transcriptomics and proteomics, single-cell RNA sequencing, and pathway analysis to explore biomarker protein and gene expression and enriched biological pathways. Additionally, we examine ATI biomarker associations with acute kidney injury (AKI) in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) ( n =44), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study ( n =4610), and the COVID-19 Host Response and Clinical Outcomes (CHROME) study ( n =268). Our /uniFB01 ndings indicate 156 plasma proteins signi /uniFB01 cantly linked to ATI with osteopontin, macrophage mannose receptor 1, and tenascin C showing the strongest associations. Pathway analysis highlight immune regulation and organelle stress responses in ATI pathogenesis.\n\nThe tubules play a crucial role in optimal functioning of the kidneys, and their impairment is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality from conditions such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) culminating in kidney failure 1,2 . Tubular lesions on histopathology have been described across virtually all forms of chronic and acute kidney diseases. The kidney tubules comprise &gt; 60% of the kidneys cellular mass and have ' amongthehighest density of mitochondria and metabolic workloads of any cell type in the body 3,4 . The high energy requirements of the tubules result from ATP-consuming reabsorption of over 99% of /uniFB01 ltered sodium, glucose, and amino acids from the glomerular ultra /uniFB01 ltrate . Several studies suggest that kidney function decline is 3 more closely correlated with tubulointerstitial damage than glomerular injury 5 -7 .\n\nAcute tubular injury (ATI) describes a combination of pathologic /uniFB01 ndings, including tubular dilatation and epithelial /uniFB02 attening, tubular cell sloughing, and loss of nuclei, that re /uniFB02 ect the morphologic responses of the tubules to a diverse range of insults 8 10 -. ATI stands as a hallmark in the diagnosis of AKI but also manifests in the context of CKD 10 . Episodes of ATI and subsequent maladaptive repair can lead to the development and progression of CKD 2,11 . Therapies focusing on preventing or treating the consequences of ATI are lacking, but could\n\nA full list of af /uniFB01 liations appears at the end of the paper. *A list of authors and their af /uniFB01 liations appears at the end of the paper. e-mail: ischmidt@bu.edu\n\nplay key roles in preventing morbidity and mortality from various kidney diseases.\n\nSeveral studies have illustrated how large-scale proteomics approaches can identify important protein markers to prognosticate the risk of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with kidney disease 12 -18 . Few studies have used this approach to determine noninvasive correlates of kidney histopathology, which could potentially lead to the identi /uniFB01 cation of new therapeutic targets 19 .\n\nIn the present study, we used an unbiased proteomics assay to measure 6592 plasma proteins in the Boston Kidney Biopsy Cohort (BKBC), a cohort study of individuals with biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmed kidney disease and adjudicated semi-quantitative assessment of ATI. We /uniFB01 rst assessed associations of each protein biomarker with ATI severity and determined enriched pathways that may have biological relevance for ATI pathogenesis. We then investigated the expression of biomarker proteins and corresponding biomarker-genes in regional proteomics and transcriptomics as well as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from human kidney. Lastly, we explored associations between our /uniFB01 ndings and the development of AKI in three additional cohort studies with available proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling: the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, andacohortofcritically ill patients from an intensive care unit (COVID19 Host Response and Clinical Outcomes (CHROME)) study.\n\n## Results\n\nAs outlined in Fig. 1, we analyzed data from (i) individuals with biopsycon rmed ATI, (ii) individuals biopsied for AKI and healthy controls, /uniFB01 (iii) individuals from the general population at risk for developing AKI, and (iv) critically ill individuals at risk of severe AKI.\n\n## Identi /uniFB01 cation and characterization of plasma biomarkers of ATI\n\nBaseline characteristics of the BKBC study cohort are shown in Table 1. The mean age was 54\u00b1 16 years and 48% were women. The mean eGFR was 51 \u00b1 33 ml/min/1.73m 2 and the median proteinuria (IQR) was 1.4 (0.3, 3.9) g/g creatinine. The most common primary clinicopathologic diagnoses were glomerulopathies (40%), diabetic nephropathy (16%), advanced chronic changes (15%), vascular disease (12%), and tubulointerstitial disease (11%). Figure 2a shows the breakdown of ATI severity by clinicopathologic diagnosis: 53% of BKBC participants had no ATI, 30% had mild ATI, 13% had moderate ATI, and 4% had severe ATI.\n\nAssociations between plasma biomarkers and ATI severity are shown in Fig. 2b and Supplemental Data 1. After multivariable adjustment and correction for multiple testing, 156 unique proteins (170 aptamers; some proteins are measured by 2 or more aptamers) were associated with ATI. Among those, higher levels of 126 proteins and lower levels of 30 proteins were independently associated with ATI severity. Higher levels of the following plasma biomarkers were associated with greater ATI severity (top 5 /uniFB01 ndings in the order of level of signi /uniFB01 cance): osteopontin ( SPP1 ), macrophage mannose receptor 1 ( MRC-1 ), tenascin C ( TNC ), netrin-4 ( NTN4 ), and marginal zone B- and B1-cell-speci /uniFB01 c protein ( MZB1 ). The top /uniFB01 ve plasma proteins negatively associated with ATI severity were plasma serine protease inhibitor ( SERPINA5 ), cholinesterase ( BCHE ), neuropeptide S ( NPS ), kallistatin ( SERPINA4) and alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein ( AHSG ). Additional proteins associated with ATI with biological relevance in kidney disease include kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1; HACVR1 ), WAP four-disul /uniFB01 de core domainprotein2(HE4; WFDC2 ), growth/differentiation factor-15 ( GDF15 ), serum amyloid A-1 protein ( SAA1 ), and serum amyloid A-2 protein ( SAA2 ).\n\nOf the 156 ATI biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in the BKBC, 78 were analyzed within the KPMP regional proteomics dataset. Comparison with glomerular expression revealed elevated protein expression of several ATI biomarkers in the tubulointerstitium (Fig. 3a). When comparing regional protein expression between individuals with AKI and healthy controls, we observed protein expression of eight ATI biomarkers. All except one (apolipoprotein A-1; APOA1 ) showed protein expression in direction concordant with greater ATI severity as observed in Study 1 (BKBC). We observed protein expression of our top ATI biomarker /uniFB01 ndings, osteopontin ( SPP1 ), macrophage mannose receptor 1 ( MRC-1 ), and tenascin C ( TNC ), in the tubulointersitium of kidneys with AKI (Fig. 3b). Utilizing regional transcriptomics data, 42 of the 156 ATI biomarkers were found to be expressed in kidney tubules, 29 of which showed higher tubular compared to glomerular expression. We observed the highest tubular expression for WFDC2, GDF15 , and SPP1 when compared to glomerular expression (Fig. 3c). Detailed expression of these three markers in different kidney cell types is shown in Supplemental Fig. 1. We observed prominent expression of WFDC2, GDF15 , and SPP1 in cell clusters of the thick ascending limb. SPP1 was also strongly expressed in distal convoluted tubule cell clusters, while GDF15 and WFDC2 expression was prominent in clusters of connecting tubule cells.\n\nOf the 156 unique proteins linked to ATI, several play roles in the regulation of the immune system and intracellular pathways. We identi /uniFB01 ed seven key pathways (all p &lt;0.05) with relevance for ATI pathogenesis. Of these, the top-ranked pathways were: ' Intracellular Organelle Lumen, ' ' Endoplasmic Reticulum Lumen, and ' ' Immune System ' (Fig. 3d). Additional pathways that had immunoregulatory capacities included ' Interactions Between Lymphoid and NonLymphoid Cells ' and Neutrophil Degranulation. ' ' Proteins involved in these pathways included several cytokines, interleukins, members of the TNF receptor superfamily, and regulators of the complement cascade (Supplemental Data 2).\n\n## Difference of ATI biomarker levels in individuals with AKI and healthy controls\n\nIn the KPMP study, we analyzed plasma concentrations of the 156 ATI biomarkers comparing individuals with AKI to healthy subjects. After Bonferroni correction, 93 unique ATI biomarkers had signi /uniFB01 cantly different plasma levels in AKI vs. healthy plasma (Fig. 4a). Of those, 77 ATI biomarkers were elevated and 16 were lower in individuals with AKI. The direction of these changes in all 93 biomarkers was consistent with the observations made in the BKBC (Fig. 4d). We observed the largest differences comparing AKI to healthy plasma levels for kidney injury molecule-1 ( HACVR1 ), WAP four-disul /uniFB01 de core domain protein 2 ( WFDC2 ), and growth/differentiation factor-15 ( GDF-15 ).\n\n## Associations of ATI biomarkers with incident AKI\n\nThe baseline characteristics of ARIC participants are shown in Supplemental Data 3. Over a median of 6.8 years, 1084 ARIC participants developedAKI. Of the 156 unique proteins identi /uniFB01 edasATIbiomarkers in Study 1 (BKBC), 122 proteins were measured in ARIC. Of those, 35 were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with higher risks and 10 with lower risks of incident AKI after multivariable adjustment (Fig. 4b and Supplemental Data 4). The direction of these associations was found to be consistent (Fig. 4d): the same 35 proteins associated with elevated risks of AKI in ARIC were also linked to more severe ATI in the BKBC. Among those were osteopontin ( SPP1 ), tenascin C ( TNC ), as well as WAP fourdisul /uniFB01 de core domain protein 2 (HE4; WFDC2 ) and growth/differentiation factor-15 ( GDF-15 ). Similarly, the 10 proteins associated with lower risks of AKI in ARIC corresponded to less severe ATI in the BKBC (Fig. 4d).\n\n## Associations of ATI biomarkers with severe AKI\n\nAmong the 268 critically ill patients enrolled into the CHROME study, 34 developed severe AKI on day 7 after ICU admission (Supplemental Data5). Of the previously identi /uniFB01 edATIbiomarkers,38uniquemarkers were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with severe AKI after adjustment for age, sex, and COVID-19 status. Of those, 36 were associated with higher risks and 2 with lower risks of severe AKI (Fig. 4c, d, and Supplemental\n\nFig. 1 | Outline of studies, study participants, and primary outcomes.

These included osteopontin ( SPP1 ), tenascin C ( TNC ), and mannose-binding lectin 2 ( LMAN2 ), among others (Fig. 4d).\n\nAdditionally, we expanded our investigation to examine associations betweenour /uniFB01 ndingsandthedevelopmentorprognosisofAKIinthree distinct cohorts with available proteomic data.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis study provides an assessment of the plasma proteome in a cohort of individuals with biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmed ATI followed by further study of the proteomic results in external cohorts. We identi /uniFB01 ed biomarkers of ATI severity, assessed their tubular expression, and conducted pathway enrichment analyses that highlighted immune regulation and organelle stress responses as central mechanisms in ATI pathogenesis.\n\nPrevious proteomics research has mainly centered on analyzing the plasma proteome to assess risks of adverse clinical outcomes in individuals with kidney disease 18,20 -22 . Fewer studies have utilized proteomics to interrogate associations between circulating proteins and kidney histopathologic changes including ATI 19,23,24 . Kidney tubular injury can lead to a signi /uniFB01 cant decrease in kidney function. While it is commonlylinked to the clinical syndrome of AKI, it may also in /uniFB02 uence the onset and progression of CKD 25 . Someof the individual proteins we investigated have previously been identi /uniFB01 ed to be associated with ATI. Among those, plasma KIM-1 stands as the most extensively studied marker 12,26 . In prior studies using both ELISA and proximity extension assay (Olink platform) 27 , we observed consistent associations of\n\nTable 1 | Baseline characteristics of BKBC participants\n\n| Baseline characteristics            | n = 434         |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Clinical characteristics            |                 |\n| Age, years                          | 54.4 \u00b1 16.2     |\n| Female                              | 206 (47.5)      |\n| Race                                |                 |\n| White                               | 286 (66.2)      |\n| Black                               | 87 (20.1)       |\n| Other                               | 59 (13.7)       |\n| eGFR, ml/min/1.73m 2                | 50.8 \u00b1 33.2     |\n| Proteinuria, g/g creatinine         | 1.4 [0.3 - 3.9] |\n| Reason for biopsy *                 |                 |\n| Proteinuria                         | 231 (53.2)      |\n| Hematuria                           | 107 (24.7)      |\n| Nephrotic syndrome                  | 50 (11.5)       |\n| Nephritic syndrome                  | 8 (1.8)         |\n| Abnormal eGFR/Other                 | 300 (69.1)      |\n| Primary clinicopathologic diagnosis |                 |\n| Proliferative glomerulonephritis    | 111 (25.6)      |\n| Diabetic nephropathy                | 68 (15.7)       |\n| Non-proliferative glomerulopathy    | 62 (14.3)       |\n| Advanced chronic changes            | 63 (14.5)       |\n| Vascular disease                    | 52 (12.0)       |\n| Tubulointerstitial disease          | 48 (11.1)       |\n| Other                               | 30 (6.9)        |\n| Co-morbid conditions                |                 |\n| Hypertension                        | 256 (59.0)      |\n| Diabetes mellitus                   | 126 (29.0)      |\n| Systemic vasculitis                 | 11 (2.5)        |\n| Systemic Lupus Erythematosus        | 8 (1.8)         |\n| Hepatitis B                         | 4 (0.9)         |\n| Hepatitis C                         | 11 (2.5)        |\n| Malignancy                          | 64 (14.7)       |\n| HIV                                 | 4 (0.9)         |\n| Solid organ transplant (non-renal)  | 14 (3.2)        |\n| Medications                         |                 |\n| ACEi                                | 131 (30.2)      |\n| ARB                                 | 70 (16.1)       |\n| MRA                                 | 11 (2.5)        |\n| Calcium channel blockers            | 120 (27.6)      |\n| Beta-blockers                       | 156 (35.9)      |\n| Immunosuppression                   | 48 (11.1)       |\n| Corticosteroids                     | 68 (15.7)       |\n\nData presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, median [IQR] and count with frequencies (%) for binary and categorical variables.

Many other /uniFB01 ndings from the present study unveil new insights that may pave the foundation for future investigation.\n\nThe biomarker most strongly associated with more severe ATI was osteopontin (OPN; SPP1 ). OPN is a 44 kD glycoprotein predominantly secreted in bone and epithelial tissues. In the kidney, expression increases during injury 29,30 . Recent mechanistic studies have identi /uniFB01 ed circulating OPN derived from kidney tubule cells as a key mediator of AKI-induced acute lung injury 31 . Another study showed that plasma OPN levels in individuals recovering from AKI\n\nwere signi /uniFB01 cantly higher when compared to individuals with irreversible loss of kidney function after AKI 32 . In the setting of CKD, higher serum OPN levels were associated with worse kidney function and greater risk of kidney failure and death 33 . Our results provide further evidence for a strong association of OPN with tubular injury and suggest its potential as a speci /uniFB01 c tool to assess for the degree of ATI. Similarly, we found a consistent relationship between higher tenascin C (TNC; TNC ) levels, more severe ATI, and greater risk of AKI across cohorts. TNC, an extracellular matrix protein, is upregulated in the tubulointerstitium of CKD patients and has been shown to be involved in the transition from AKI to CKD by impairing tubular integrity through \u03b1 \u03b2 v 6 integrin signaling 34 .\n\nWe also observed strong associations between ATI severity and human epididymis protein-4 (HE4; WFDC2 ) and growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15; GDF-15 ). Both markers had higher levels in AKI, were associated with incident AKI, and were also among the top markers expressed in kidney tubules. HE4 is a serine protease inhibitor that has recently been shown to promote kidney /uniFB01 brosis by inhibiting the degradation of type I collagen 35 . Studies also found a positive correlation between higher HE4 levels and more severe kidney /uniFB01 brosis 36,37 . A prior investigation in diabetic kidney disease demonstrated that higher HE4 levels associated with increased risks of future kidney function decline 38 . Our study adds that HE4 may play an important role in the development of ATI. Additionally, the upregulation of this marker in both CKD (as shown in prior studies) and AKI underscores the interconnectedness between the two conditions and may provide additional evidence for the importance of kidney tubular injury in CKD progression 12,13,26,39 .\n\nGDF-15 is a member of the TGF\u03b2 superfamily and has recently been described as a marker of oxidative stress in mitochondrial diseases 40,41 . In the kidney, GDF-15 exhibits a range of functions that are variably antagonistic or complementary, contingent upon the cellular state and surrounding microenvironment 42 45 -. While some studies have found a potentially nephroprotective role for GDF-15 through the regulation of tubular Klotho expression 43 and downregulation of in /uniFB02 ammatory activities 45 48 -, elevated levels of circulating and urinary GDF-15 have been linked to increased risks of incident CKD, CKD progression, and death in individuals with kidney disease 44,45 , as well as higher risk of cardio-renal outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes 49 . After ischemia-reperfusion injury, GDF-15-de /uniFB01 cient mice had more severe ATI whereas recombinant GDF-15 attenuated kidney injury 50 . It is possible that in patients with kidney disease, GDF-15 levels may not have a pathogenic role but rather re /uniFB02 ect a compensatory response to acute or chronic injury that is present in the setting of oxidative stress. To our knowledge, this is the /uniFB01 rst study to investigate the association between biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmed ATI and GDF-15 in a large cohort of individuals with a diverse spectrum of kidney diseases. The observed association between higher GDF-15-levels and more severe ATI may yield further con rmation for the central /uniFB01 role of mitochondrial dysfunction in acute and chronic kidney disease where GDF-15 may act as an important mediator of mitochondrial stress responses 41 .\n\nAnother ATI marker associated with AKI across all cohort studies was LMAN2, which has been previously shown by Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses to be causally associated with kidney function. LMAN2, a protein also known as vesicular integral-membrane protein (VIP36), is implicated in transport processes and metabolic activities occurring on the apical surface of kidney epithelial cells 51 . Prior studies have demonstrated that LMAN2 correlates with albuminuria and is associated with kidney function decline 51,52 . A number of biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in this study, especially those with previously demonstrated signi /uniFB01 cant MR /uniFB01 ndings, merit additional evaluation for their therapeutic potential in a range of kidney diseases.\n\nWe found lower levels of seven plasma proteins to be associated with more severe ATI that were also signi /uniFB01 cantly lower in individuals\n\nFig. 2 | Acute tubular injury (ATI) scores and identi /uniFB01 cation of ATI biomarkers. a Distribution of semiquantitative severity scores for ATI by clinicopathologic diagnostic category in the Boston Kidney Biopsy Cohort (BKBC), Study 1. b Circulating plasma proteins associated with ATI severity in native kidney biopsy specimens.

Amongthosewasplasmakallikrein ( KLKB1 ), a serine protease inhibitor implicated in coagulation and blood pressure regulation 53 . Concordant with our observations, another investigation in type 1 diabetes revealed that plasma kallikrein activity decreased in more advanced stages of diabetic nephropathy, reaching its lowest levels in individuals undergoing dialysis 54 . Additionally, a recent genome-wide association study in the German CKD Study on OPN revealed a signi /uniFB01 cant association at a locus within KLKB1 , suggesting a potential link between OPN and the kallikrein-kinin system 55 . We also found that levels of complement C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 3 (C1QTNF3; C1QTNF3 ), a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family, were lower in individuals with AKI. This is congruent with a smaller investigation focused on diabetic patients, which reported lower serum levels of C1QTNF3 in those with type 2 diabetes when compared to healthy controls 56 . These /uniFB01 ndings are further supported by in vitro experiments demonstrating that C1QTNF3 mitigates TGF\u03b2 1-mediated kidney /uniFB01 brosis 57 and ameliorates lipid accumulation and necroin/uniFB02 ammation induced by high glucose concentrations in renal tubular cells 58 .\n\nWhile the functional signi /uniFB01 cance and potential prognostic value of these proteins remain to be fully investigated, many of them are involved in common biological pathways relevant to tubular injury such as regulation of immune and cellular stress responses. The leading pathways in our study related to cellular organelle stress including mitochondrial or endoplasmic reticulum damage. These pathways are critical in AKI onset and can also drive in /uniFB02 ammation and /uniFB01 brosis, key factors in the transition from AKI to CKD when stress is sustained 59 . In fact, several markers found in this study are markers involved in the pathogenesis of both AKI and CKD. Traditionally, ATI parameters have not been systematically assessed in biopsies obtained for CKD evaluation. It is possible, however, that the extent of ATI could serve as a valuable prognostic indicator for assessing the likelihood of transitioning from acute to chronic kidney injury, underscoring the potential bene /uniFB01 t of incorporating routine ATI assessment in CKD biopsies to enhance prognostic accuracy.\n\nSigni /uniFB01 cant strengths of our study include the large number of protein biomarkers included in the analyses. Detailed adjudicated histopathologic scores by two kidney pathologists allowed us to test associations between markers and the degree of ATI. We were able to\n\nmodels, adjusted for age, sex, race, and eGFR. The horizontal dotted line shows the Bonferroni-adjusted signi /uniFB01 cance threshold. P -values are two-sided.

Our study has several limitations that warrant consideration as well. Given the intrinsic limitations of cross-sectional studies, which prevent the establishment of causality, additional experimental and clinical studies are needed to establish the causal role of the ATI biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in this study. While our study cohort underwent comprehensive phenotypic characterization, enabling extensive multivariable adjustment, we cannot exclude the potential in /uniFB02 uence of unmeasured confounding variables on our results. Our study delineates several proteins that warrant further investigation in animal models to elucidate their tissue-speci /uniFB01 c function within the kidney.\n\nIn conclusion, our proteomics study identi /uniFB01 ed over 150 proteins in the plasma of individuals with histologically con rmed tubular /uniFB01 injury, with subsequent interrogation of /uniFB01 ndings in separate cohort studies with plasma proteomics, regional proteomics, and single-cell transcriptomics.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Ethical compliance\n\nWehavecompliedwithallethical regulations related to this study. All studies included received approval from their respective institutional review boards (IRB) at each participating center which included the Mass General Brigham IRB (BKBC study), the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill IRB (ARIC Study), the Johns Hopkins University IRB (ARIC Study), the University of Minnesota IRB (ARIC Study), the University of Mississippi Medical Center IRB (ARIC Study), and the University of Washington IRB (KPMP and CHROME studies). Informed consent was obtained from participants of the BKBC, ARIC, and KPMP studies. In the CHROME study, participants were enrolled under an IRB-approved waiver of informed consent. All studies were conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n## Study populations\n\nThe BKBC is a prospective, observational cohort study of patients who underwent native kidney biopsy at three tertiary care hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts, including Brigham and Womens Hospital, ' Massachusetts General Hospital, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical\n\nFig. 3 | Expression of acute tubular injury (ATI) biomarkers in regional proteomics and transcriptomics data and pathway analysis. a ATI biomarkers with elevated protein expression comparing tubulointerstitial to glomerular levels in KPMPregionalproteomicsdata(AKI, CKD,HRT combined). b Protein expression of ATI biomarkers in the tubulointerstitium of individuals with AKI compared to healthy controls using Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test and Benjamini -Hochberg FDR to account for multiple comparisons.

The study includes adults \u2265 18 years of age who underwent a clinically indicated kidney biopsy between September 2006 and October 2018. Exclusion criteria were the inability to provide written consent, severe anemia, pregnancy, and enrollment in competing studies. Details of the study design have been previously described 60 . Patients provided blood samples on the day of kidney biopsy. For this study, we evaluated 434 participants with available plasma samples. The KPMP is a multicenter prospective cohort study of people with CKD or AKI who undergo a protocol kidney biopsy at study entry as part of the KPMP consortium (https://KPMP.org) 61 . For plasma proteomics analyses, we evaluated protein measurements of 44 participants (26 with AKI and 18 who provided healthy reference tissue). The ARIC study is a prospective cohort study of individuals recruited from four US communities 62 . Participants were enrolled between 1987 and 1989, with subsequent visits in 1990 -1992 (visit 2), 1993 -1995 (visit 3), 1996 1998 -(visit 4), 2011 -2013 (visit 5), 2016 2017 -(visit 6), and 2018 2019 (visit 7), visit -8 (2020), visit 9 (2021 -2022), and visit 10 (2023). In this study, we included 4,610 participants from visit 5 who had available plasma proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling and non-missing covariates at baseline. The CHROME study is a prospective cohort study of critically ill patients admitted to three hospitals af /uniFB01 liated with the University of Washington in Seattle, WA between March 2020 and May 2021. Details of the study design have been previously described 63 . In brief, patients were eligible if admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU) with signs or symptoms of acute respiratory illness. Exclusion criteria included being under 18 years of age, incarcerated, pregnant, or undergoing chronic maintenance hemodialysis. In this study, we included 268 individuals with available SOMAScan plasma proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling. All studies included in this manuscript received approval from their respective institutional review boards at each participating center.\n\n## Sample collection and proteomics assays\n\nProteomic pro /uniFB01 ling was performed on blood samples from the baseline visit of the BKBC, KPMP, and CHROME cohort, as well as visit 5 of the ARIC study. After collection, blood samples were aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0C. The SOMAscan assay was utilized for proteomic measurements 64 . This assay employs SOMAmers (selective singlestranded deoxyoligonucleotides) for protein binding and quanti /uniFB01 es proteins based on /uniFB02 uorescence intensity, indicative of relative protein concentrations. The ARIC and CHROME plasma samples were analyzed using the SOMAscan 5k platform (approximately 5000 proteins), while the BKBC and KPMP samples were assessed using the SOMAscan 7k platform (approximately 7000 proteins). In the BKBC, 6592 aptamers passed quality control metrics and were included in subsequent analyses; the mean coef /uniFB01 cient of variation (CV) on 8 blind duplicate pairs was 4.7%. In ARIC, KPMP, and the CHROME cohort, we evaluated only those proteins that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with ATI in the BKBC (156 unique proteins). For ARIC visit 5, the mean Bland Altman coef /uniFB01 cient of variation was 6.6% from 26 samples in blind triplicate. In KPMP, the mean CVs on 2 sets of 4 blind duplicates was 4.9%. For all studies, protein aptamers were log2-transformed and winsorized at mean\u00b15\u00d7SD and adaptive normalization was performed by maximum likelihood as previously described 64 .\n\n## Histopathologic outcome\n\nIn the BKBC, kidney biopsy specimens were adjudicated under light microscopy by two experienced kidney pathologists who provided semiquantitative scores of ATI scored from 0 to 3 re /uniFB02 ecting none, mild, moderate, and severe lesion severity. Methods to evaluate and score histopathologic lesion severity were previously described in detail 60 . The weighted kappa statistic (95% CI) from 26 randomly selected biopsies for repeat review months after the initial scoring for ATI was 0.67 (0.45 -0.89) 60 . All participants ' charts were reviewed alongside histopathologic evaluations to provide the /uniFB01 nal primary clinicopathologic diagnosis.\n\n## Outcome of acute kidney injury\n\nIn KPMP, patients eligible for percutaneous kidney biopsy for AKI must have elevated serum creatinine that is either sustained or accompanied by evidence of parenchymal injury. Detailed inclusion criteria for AKI biopsies were previously described in detail 61 . In ARIC, individuals included in this study were free of AKI at baseline and followed prospectively for incident AKI. Incident cases of AKI were identi /uniFB01 ed by International Classi /uniFB01 cation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modi /uniFB01 cation (ICD-9-CM) codes 584.5 to 584.9 and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modi cation (ICD-10-CM) codes N17.0 to N17.9 or a 50% increase from /uniFB01 outpatient serum creatinine during hospitalization. ICD codes were retrieved from hospital discharge billing and death certi /uniFB01 cates 65 . In the CHROME Cohort, the primary outcome was severe AKI within 7 days, de ned by either initiation of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) or a /uniFB01 doubling of serum creatinine from ICU admission 63 . In the ARIC and CHROME studies, blood samples were collected prior to the diagnosis of AKI or severe AKI, respectively.\n\n## Covariates\n\nIn the BKBC, detailed patient information was collected at the biopsy visit, including demographics, medical history, medication lists, and pertinent laboratory data and stored using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Partners Health Care. We obtained serum creatinine (SCr) from the electronic medical record (EMR) on the day of biopsy. In participants for whom this was unavailable, we measured SCr in available blood samples collected on the day of the biopsy. We obtained spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) from the date of kidney biopsy to 3monthsbeforebiopsyfromtheEMR.Ifbothwereavailable,theUACR wasused.Ifaparticipant did not have any of thesevalues, we measured urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio from urine collected on the day of the kidney biopsy. SCr and urine creatinine were measured using a Jaffebased method and urine albumin was measured by an immunoturbidometric method. The creatinine-based Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration 2021 equation was used to calculate the eGFR 66 . In ARIC, covariates included age, sex, self-reported race, systolic blood pressure (SBP), UACR, smoking status, diabetes (fasting glucose of \u2265 126 mg/dL or non-fasting glucose level of \u2265 200mg/dL, self-reported history of diabetes diagnosed by a physician, or use of medications for diabetes), hypertension (SBP \u2265 140 mm Hg and DBP \u2265 90mm Hg, or use of medication for high BP), and eGFR (calculated using the CKD-EPI 2021 equation, which takes both serum creatinine and cystatin C into account) 66 . Serum creatinine was measured using a Roche enzymatic method (visit 5) and serum cystatin C was measured using the Roche Cobas 6000 chemistry analyzer. The UACR was calculated using urine albumin and creatinine (measured using an immunoturbidometric method on the ProSpec nephelometric analyzer and the Roche enzymatic method, respectively). In CHROME, covariates including age, sex, and COVID-19 status were extracted from the EMR.\n\n## Regional proteomics\n\nWeinvestigated the expression of ATI biomarker proteins in regional tissue proteomics from KPMP kidney biopsy samples (https://atlas. kpmp.org/explorer/regionalpro; access date: April 20, 2024). Detailed protocols and dataset information are available at https:// www.kpmp.org/help-docs/technologies. In brief, kidney tissue was laser-microdissected to isolate glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartments. Following protein extraction from targeted tissue sections, proteins were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) for comprehensive identi /uniFB01 cation and quanti /uniFB01 cation. The study included tissue samples from 31 individuals (12 with AKI, 14 with CKD, and 5 healthy controls). We analyzed and compared the expression pro /uniFB01 les of ATI biomarkers between the tubulointerstitial and glomerular\n\ncompartments across all participants, and separately, evaluated differences in tubulointerstitial protein expression between healthy controls and those with AKI.\n\n## Kidney gene expression analysis\n\nTo map biomarker proteins to gene expression data, we investigated the expression of ATI biomarker-corresponding genes using regional transcriptomics and scRNA-seq data from KPMP (https://atlas.kpmp. org/explorer; access date: August 1, 2023). Tissue samples used for regional transcriptomics were drawn from living donor biopsy participants and used to compare expression (Fold Change) of our ATI biomarker genes of interest in the tubulointerstitium ( n =36; 9 healthy reference, 22 CKD, 5 AKI). Tissue samples analyzed using scRNA-seq were drawn from 47 participants (12 with AKI, 15 with CKD, and 20 healthy controls) and used to test for differential gene expression in kidney cell types. Details on these datasets have been described previously 67,68 .\n\n## Pathway analysis\n\nTo obtain basic functional information on biomarker proteins that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with ATI severity and to investigate potentially relevant biological pathways, we applied Pathway Enrichment Analysis using gene sets obtained from publicly available databases including Gene Ontology, KEGG, and Reactome 69,70 . We ranked proteins based on their strength of association with ATI. We then calculated normalized enrichment scores to identify pathways with signi /uniFB01 cant overrepresentation of ATI biomarkers. The Benjamini -Hochbergapproachwas employed to account for multiple testings and used to rank pathways based on the obtained p -value. Analyses were performed using the R package fgsea.\n\n## Statistical analysis\n\nWe summarized descriptive statistics as count with percentages for categorical variables and mean \u00b1 standard deviation or median with interquartile range for continuous variables. For skewed data distributions, we performed logarithmic transformation as appropriate. In the BKBC, multivariable linear regression models were used to assess associations of each plasma biomarker protein with ATI severity. In these models, the ATI severity score was used as the independent variable and each log2-transformed biomarker as the dependent variable. The adjusted model included the covariates age, race, sex, and eGFR. A prespeci /uniFB01 ed \u03b1 level of 7.58\u00d710 -6 set by Bonferroni correction (0.05/6592 proteins) was used to determine statistical signi /uniFB01 cance. In ARIC, we used Cox proportional hazards models to test associations between the ATI biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in the BKBC and the outcome of incident AKI. Models were adjusted for age, sex, selfreported race, SBP, smoking status, diabetes, hypertension UACR, and eGFR. In KPMP, we compared plasma levels of the ATI biomarkers in individuals with AKI and healthy controls using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). In the CHROME cohort, we explored associations between the ATI biomarkers and severe AKI within 7 days of ICU admission using logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and COVID-19 status. In KPMP, we used a Bonferroni-corrected signi /uniFB01 cance threshold of p &lt;3.21 \u00d7 10 -4 (0.05/156 proteins). In ARIC and CHROME, we adjusted this threshold to p &lt;4.1 \u00d7 10 -4 (0.05/122 proteins) and p &lt;3.79 \u00d7 10 -4 (0.05/132 proteins), respectively, re /uniFB02 ecting that only measurements of 122 (ARIC) and 132 (CHROME) of the 156 ATI biomarkerswereavailable. In other analyses, we considered a two-sided p -value &lt; 0.05 statistically signi /uniFB01 cant. Statistical analyses were performed using R Version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and STATA 18.0 (STATACorp, College Station, TX).\n\n## Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAccess to ARIC data follows NIH data sharing policies.

Waikar 1,2\n\nReceived: 13 February 2024\n\nAccepted: 5 August 2024\n\nCheck for updates\n\nThekidney tubules constitute two-thirds of the cells of the kidney and account for the majority of the organ s metabolic energy expenditure. Acute tubular ' injury (ATI) is observed across various types of kidney diseases and may signi /uniFB01 cantly contribute to progression to kidney failure. Non-invasive biomarkers of ATI may allow for early detection and drug development. Using the SomaScanproteomics platform on 434 patients with biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmedkidney disease, we here identify plasma biomarkers associated with ATI severity. We employ regional transcriptomics and proteomics, single-cell RNA sequencing, and pathway analysis to explore biomarker protein and gene expression and enriched biological pathways. Additionally, we examine ATI biomarker associations with acute kidney injury (AKI) in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) ( n =44), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study ( n =4610), and the COVID-19 Host Response and Clinical Outcomes (CHROME) study ( n =268). Our /uniFB01 ndings indicate 156 plasma proteins signi /uniFB01 cantly linked to ATI with osteopontin, macrophage mannose receptor 1, and tenascin C showing the strongest associations. Pathway analysis highlight immune regulation and organelle stress responses in ATI pathogenesis.\n\nThe tubules play a crucial role in optimal functioning of the kidneys, and their impairment is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality from conditions such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) culminating in kidney failure 1,2 . Tubular lesions on histopathology have been described across virtually all forms of chronic and acute kidney diseases. The kidney tubules comprise &gt; 60% of the kidneys cellular mass and have ' amongthehighest density of mitochondria and metabolic workloads of any cell type in the body 3,4 . The high energy requirements of the tubules result from ATP-consuming reabsorption of over 99% of /uniFB01 ltered sodium, glucose, and amino acids from the glomerular ultra /uniFB01 ltrate . Several studies suggest that kidney function decline is 3 more closely correlated with tubulointerstitial damage than glomerular injury 5 -7 .\n\nAcute tubular injury (ATI) describes a combination of pathologic /uniFB01 ndings, including tubular dilatation and epithelial /uniFB02 attening, tubular cell sloughing, and loss of nuclei, that re /uniFB02 ect the morphologic responses of the tubules to a diverse range of insults 8 10 -. ATI stands as a hallmark in the diagnosis of AKI but also manifests in the context of CKD 10 . Episodes of ATI and subsequent maladaptive repair can lead to the development and progression of CKD 2,11 . Therapies focusing on preventing or treating the consequences of ATI are lacking, but could\n\nA full list of af /uniFB01 liations appears at the end of the paper. *A list of authors and their af /uniFB01 liations appears at the end of the paper. e-mail: ischmidt@bu.edu\n\nplay key roles in preventing morbidity and mortality from various kidney diseases.\n\nSeveral studies have illustrated how large-scale proteomics approaches can identify important protein markers to prognosticate the risk of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with kidney disease 12 -18 . Few studies have used this approach to determine noninvasive correlates of kidney histopathology, which could potentially lead to the identi /uniFB01 cation of new therapeutic targets 19 .\n\nIn the present study, we used an unbiased proteomics assay to measure 6592 plasma proteins in the Boston Kidney Biopsy Cohort (BKBC), a cohort study of individuals with biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmed kidney disease and adjudicated semi-quantitative assessment of ATI. We /uniFB01 rst assessed associations of each protein biomarker with ATI severity and determined enriched pathways that may have biological relevance for ATI pathogenesis. We then investigated the expression of biomarker proteins and corresponding biomarker-genes in regional proteomics and transcriptomics as well as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from human kidney. Lastly, we explored associations between our /uniFB01 ndings and the development of AKI in three additional cohort studies with available proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling: the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, andacohortofcritically ill patients from an intensive care unit (COVID19 Host Response and Clinical Outcomes (CHROME)) study.\n\n## Results\n\nAs outlined in Fig. 1, we analyzed data from (i) individuals with biopsycon rmed ATI, (ii) individuals biopsied for AKI and healthy controls, /uniFB01 (iii) individuals from the general population at risk for developing AKI, and (iv) critically ill individuals at risk of severe AKI.\n\n## Identi /uniFB01 cation and characterization of plasma biomarkers of ATI\n\nBaseline characteristics of the BKBC study cohort are shown in Table 1. The mean age was 54\u00b1 16 years and 48% were women. The mean eGFR was 51 \u00b1 33 ml/min/1.73m 2 and the median proteinuria (IQR) was 1.4 (0.3, 3.9) g/g creatinine. The most common primary clinicopathologic diagnoses were glomerulopathies (40%), diabetic nephropathy (16%), advanced chronic changes (15%), vascular disease (12%), and tubulointerstitial disease (11%). Figure 2a shows the breakdown of ATI severity by clinicopathologic diagnosis: 53% of BKBC participants had no ATI, 30% had mild ATI, 13% had moderate ATI, and 4% had severe ATI.\n\nAssociations between plasma biomarkers and ATI severity are shown in Fig. 2b and Supplemental Data 1. After multivariable adjustment and correction for multiple testing, 156 unique proteins (170 aptamers; some proteins are measured by 2 or more aptamers) were associated with ATI. Among those, higher levels of 126 proteins and lower levels of 30 proteins were independently associated with ATI severity. Higher levels of the following plasma biomarkers were associated with greater ATI severity (top 5 /uniFB01 ndings in the order of level of signi /uniFB01 cance): osteopontin ( SPP1 ), macrophage mannose receptor 1 ( MRC-1 ), tenascin C ( TNC ), netrin-4 ( NTN4 ), and marginal zone B- and B1-cell-speci /uniFB01 c protein ( MZB1 ). The top /uniFB01 ve plasma proteins negatively associated with ATI severity were plasma serine protease inhibitor ( SERPINA5 ), cholinesterase ( BCHE ), neuropeptide S ( NPS ), kallistatin ( SERPINA4) and alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein ( AHSG ). Additional proteins associated with ATI with biological relevance in kidney disease include kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1; HACVR1 ), WAP four-disul /uniFB01 de core domainprotein2(HE4; WFDC2 ), growth/differentiation factor-15 ( GDF15 ), serum amyloid A-1 protein ( SAA1 ), and serum amyloid A-2 protein ( SAA2 ).\n\nOf the 156 ATI biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in the BKBC, 78 were analyzed within the KPMP regional proteomics dataset. Comparison with glomerular expression revealed elevated protein expression of several ATI biomarkers in the tubulointerstitium (Fig. 3a). When comparing regional protein expression between individuals with AKI and healthy controls, we observed protein expression of eight ATI biomarkers. All except one (apolipoprotein A-1; APOA1 ) showed protein expression in direction concordant with greater ATI severity as observed in Study 1 (BKBC). We observed protein expression of our top ATI biomarker /uniFB01 ndings, osteopontin ( SPP1 ), macrophage mannose receptor 1 ( MRC-1 ), and tenascin C ( TNC ), in the tubulointersitium of kidneys with AKI (Fig. 3b). Utilizing regional transcriptomics data, 42 of the 156 ATI biomarkers were found to be expressed in kidney tubules, 29 of which showed higher tubular compared to glomerular expression. We observed the highest tubular expression for WFDC2, GDF15 , and SPP1 when compared to glomerular expression (Fig. 3c). Detailed expression of these three markers in different kidney cell types is shown in Supplemental Fig. 1. We observed prominent expression of WFDC2, GDF15 , and SPP1 in cell clusters of the thick ascending limb. SPP1 was also strongly expressed in distal convoluted tubule cell clusters, while GDF15 and WFDC2 expression was prominent in clusters of connecting tubule cells.\n\nOf the 156 unique proteins linked to ATI, several play roles in the regulation of the immune system and intracellular pathways. We identi /uniFB01 ed seven key pathways (all p &lt;0.05) with relevance for ATI pathogenesis. Of these, the top-ranked pathways were: ' Intracellular Organelle Lumen, ' ' Endoplasmic Reticulum Lumen, and ' ' Immune System ' (Fig. 3d). Additional pathways that had immunoregulatory capacities included ' Interactions Between Lymphoid and NonLymphoid Cells ' and Neutrophil Degranulation. ' ' Proteins involved in these pathways included several cytokines, interleukins, members of the TNF receptor superfamily, and regulators of the complement cascade (Supplemental Data 2).\n\n## Difference of ATI biomarker levels in individuals with AKI and healthy controls\n\nIn the KPMP study, we analyzed plasma concentrations of the 156 ATI biomarkers comparing individuals with AKI to healthy subjects. After Bonferroni correction, 93 unique ATI biomarkers had signi /uniFB01 cantly different plasma levels in AKI vs. healthy plasma (Fig. 4a). Of those, 77 ATI biomarkers were elevated and 16 were lower in individuals with AKI. The direction of these changes in all 93 biomarkers was consistent with the observations made in the BKBC (Fig. 4d). We observed the largest differences comparing AKI to healthy plasma levels for kidney injury molecule-1 ( HACVR1 ), WAP four-disul /uniFB01 de core domain protein 2 ( WFDC2 ), and growth/differentiation factor-15 ( GDF-15 ).\n\n## Associations of ATI biomarkers with incident AKI\n\nThe baseline characteristics of ARIC participants are shown in Supplemental Data 3. Over a median of 6.8 years, 1084 ARIC participants developedAKI. Of the 156 unique proteins identi /uniFB01 edasATIbiomarkers in Study 1 (BKBC), 122 proteins were measured in ARIC. Of those, 35 were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with higher risks and 10 with lower risks of incident AKI after multivariable adjustment (Fig. 4b and Supplemental Data 4). The direction of these associations was found to be consistent (Fig. 4d): the same 35 proteins associated with elevated risks of AKI in ARIC were also linked to more severe ATI in the BKBC. Among those were osteopontin ( SPP1 ), tenascin C ( TNC ), as well as WAP fourdisul /uniFB01 de core domain protein 2 (HE4; WFDC2 ) and growth/differentiation factor-15 ( GDF-15 ). Similarly, the 10 proteins associated with lower risks of AKI in ARIC corresponded to less severe ATI in the BKBC (Fig. 4d).\n\n## Associations of ATI biomarkers with severe AKI\n\nAmong the 268 critically ill patients enrolled into the CHROME study, 34 developed severe AKI on day 7 after ICU admission (Supplemental Data5). Of the previously identi /uniFB01 edATIbiomarkers,38uniquemarkers were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with severe AKI after adjustment for age, sex, and COVID-19 status. Of those, 36 were associated with higher risks and 2 with lower risks of severe AKI (Fig. 4c, d, and Supplemental\n\nFig. 1 | Outline of studies, study participants, and primary outcomes.

These included osteopontin ( SPP1 ), tenascin C ( TNC ), and mannose-binding lectin 2 ( LMAN2 ), among others (Fig. 4d).\n\nAdditionally, we expanded our investigation to examine associations betweenour /uniFB01 ndingsandthedevelopmentorprognosisofAKIinthree distinct cohorts with available proteomic data.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis study provides an assessment of the plasma proteome in a cohort of individuals with biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmed ATI followed by further study of the proteomic results in external cohorts. We identi /uniFB01 ed biomarkers of ATI severity, assessed their tubular expression, and conducted pathway enrichment analyses that highlighted immune regulation and organelle stress responses as central mechanisms in ATI pathogenesis.\n\nPrevious proteomics research has mainly centered on analyzing the plasma proteome to assess risks of adverse clinical outcomes in individuals with kidney disease 18,20 -22 . Fewer studies have utilized proteomics to interrogate associations between circulating proteins and kidney histopathologic changes including ATI 19,23,24 . Kidney tubular injury can lead to a signi /uniFB01 cant decrease in kidney function. While it is commonlylinked to the clinical syndrome of AKI, it may also in /uniFB02 uence the onset and progression of CKD 25 . Someof the individual proteins we investigated have previously been identi /uniFB01 ed to be associated with ATI. Among those, plasma KIM-1 stands as the most extensively studied marker 12,26 . In prior studies using both ELISA and proximity extension assay (Olink platform) 27 , we observed consistent associations of\n\nTable 1 | Baseline characteristics of BKBC participants\n\n| Baseline characteristics            | n = 434         |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Clinical characteristics            |                 |\n| Age, years                          | 54.4 \u00b1 16.2     |\n| Female                              | 206 (47.5)      |\n| Race                                |                 |\n| White                               | 286 (66.2)      |\n| Black                               | 87 (20.1)       |\n| Other                               | 59 (13.7)       |\n| eGFR, ml/min/1.73m 2                | 50.8 \u00b1 33.2     |\n| Proteinuria, g/g creatinine         | 1.4 [0.3 - 3.9] |\n| Reason for biopsy *                 |                 |\n| Proteinuria                         | 231 (53.2)      |\n| Hematuria                           | 107 (24.7)      |\n| Nephrotic syndrome                  | 50 (11.5)       |\n| Nephritic syndrome                  | 8 (1.8)         |\n| Abnormal eGFR/Other                 | 300 (69.1)      |\n| Primary clinicopathologic diagnosis |                 |\n| Proliferative glomerulonephritis    | 111 (25.6)      |\n| Diabetic nephropathy                | 68 (15.7)       |\n| Non-proliferative glomerulopathy    | 62 (14.3)       |\n| Advanced chronic changes            | 63 (14.5)       |\n| Vascular disease                    | 52 (12.0)       |\n| Tubulointerstitial disease          | 48 (11.1)       |\n| Other                               | 30 (6.9)        |\n| Co-morbid conditions                |                 |\n| Hypertension                        | 256 (59.0)      |\n| Diabetes mellitus                   | 126 (29.0)      |\n| Systemic vasculitis                 | 11 (2.5)        |\n| Systemic Lupus Erythematosus        | 8 (1.8)         |\n| Hepatitis B                         | 4 (0.9)         |\n| Hepatitis C                         | 11 (2.5)        |\n| Malignancy                          | 64 (14.7)       |\n| HIV                                 | 4 (0.9)         |\n| Solid organ transplant (non-renal)  | 14 (3.2)        |\n| Medications                         |                 |\n| ACEi                                | 131 (30.2)      |\n| ARB                                 | 70 (16.1)       |\n| MRA                                 | 11 (2.5)        |\n| Calcium channel blockers            | 120 (27.6)      |\n| Beta-blockers                       | 156 (35.9)      |\n| Immunosuppression                   | 48 (11.1)       |\n| Corticosteroids                     | 68 (15.7)       |\n\nData presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, median [IQR] and count with frequencies (%) for binary and categorical variables.

Many other /uniFB01 ndings from the present study unveil new insights that may pave the foundation for future investigation.\n\nThe biomarker most strongly associated with more severe ATI was osteopontin (OPN; SPP1 ). OPN is a 44 kD glycoprotein predominantly secreted in bone and epithelial tissues. In the kidney, expression increases during injury 29,30 . Recent mechanistic studies have identi /uniFB01 ed circulating OPN derived from kidney tubule cells as a key mediator of AKI-induced acute lung injury 31 . Another study showed that plasma OPN levels in individuals recovering from AKI\n\nwere signi /uniFB01 cantly higher when compared to individuals with irreversible loss of kidney function after AKI 32 . In the setting of CKD, higher serum OPN levels were associated with worse kidney function and greater risk of kidney failure and death 33 . Our results provide further evidence for a strong association of OPN with tubular injury and suggest its potential as a speci /uniFB01 c tool to assess for the degree of ATI. Similarly, we found a consistent relationship between higher tenascin C (TNC; TNC ) levels, more severe ATI, and greater risk of AKI across cohorts. TNC, an extracellular matrix protein, is upregulated in the tubulointerstitium of CKD patients and has been shown to be involved in the transition from AKI to CKD by impairing tubular integrity through \u03b1 \u03b2 v 6 integrin signaling 34 .\n\nWe also observed strong associations between ATI severity and human epididymis protein-4 (HE4; WFDC2 ) and growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15; GDF-15 ). Both markers had higher levels in AKI, were associated with incident AKI, and were also among the top markers expressed in kidney tubules. HE4 is a serine protease inhibitor that has recently been shown to promote kidney /uniFB01 brosis by inhibiting the degradation of type I collagen 35 . Studies also found a positive correlation between higher HE4 levels and more severe kidney /uniFB01 brosis 36,37 . A prior investigation in diabetic kidney disease demonstrated that higher HE4 levels associated with increased risks of future kidney function decline 38 . Our study adds that HE4 may play an important role in the development of ATI. Additionally, the upregulation of this marker in both CKD (as shown in prior studies) and AKI underscores the interconnectedness between the two conditions and may provide additional evidence for the importance of kidney tubular injury in CKD progression 12,13,26,39 .\n\nGDF-15 is a member of the TGF\u03b2 superfamily and has recently been described as a marker of oxidative stress in mitochondrial diseases 40,41 . In the kidney, GDF-15 exhibits a range of functions that are variably antagonistic or complementary, contingent upon the cellular state and surrounding microenvironment 42 45 -. While some studies have found a potentially nephroprotective role for GDF-15 through the regulation of tubular Klotho expression 43 and downregulation of in /uniFB02 ammatory activities 45 48 -, elevated levels of circulating and urinary GDF-15 have been linked to increased risks of incident CKD, CKD progression, and death in individuals with kidney disease 44,45 , as well as higher risk of cardio-renal outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes 49 . After ischemia-reperfusion injury, GDF-15-de /uniFB01 cient mice had more severe ATI whereas recombinant GDF-15 attenuated kidney injury 50 . It is possible that in patients with kidney disease, GDF-15 levels may not have a pathogenic role but rather re /uniFB02 ect a compensatory response to acute or chronic injury that is present in the setting of oxidative stress. To our knowledge, this is the /uniFB01 rst study to investigate the association between biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmed ATI and GDF-15 in a large cohort of individuals with a diverse spectrum of kidney diseases. The observed association between higher GDF-15-levels and more severe ATI may yield further con rmation for the central /uniFB01 role of mitochondrial dysfunction in acute and chronic kidney disease where GDF-15 may act as an important mediator of mitochondrial stress responses 41 .\n\nAnother ATI marker associated with AKI across all cohort studies was LMAN2, which has been previously shown by Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses to be causally associated with kidney function. LMAN2, a protein also known as vesicular integral-membrane protein (VIP36), is implicated in transport processes and metabolic activities occurring on the apical surface of kidney epithelial cells 51 . Prior studies have demonstrated that LMAN2 correlates with albuminuria and is associated with kidney function decline 51,52 . A number of biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in this study, especially those with previously demonstrated signi /uniFB01 cant MR /uniFB01 ndings, merit additional evaluation for their therapeutic potential in a range of kidney diseases.\n\nWe found lower levels of seven plasma proteins to be associated with more severe ATI that were also signi /uniFB01 cantly lower in individuals\n\nFig. 2 | Acute tubular injury (ATI) scores and identi /uniFB01 cation of ATI biomarkers. a Distribution of semiquantitative severity scores for ATI by clinicopathologic diagnostic category in the Boston Kidney Biopsy Cohort (BKBC), Study 1. b Circulating plasma proteins associated with ATI severity in native kidney biopsy specimens.

Amongthosewasplasmakallikrein ( KLKB1 ), a serine protease inhibitor implicated in coagulation and blood pressure regulation 53 . Concordant with our observations, another investigation in type 1 diabetes revealed that plasma kallikrein activity decreased in more advanced stages of diabetic nephropathy, reaching its lowest levels in individuals undergoing dialysis 54 . Additionally, a recent genome-wide association study in the German CKD Study on OPN revealed a signi /uniFB01 cant association at a locus within KLKB1 , suggesting a potential link between OPN and the kallikrein-kinin system 55 . We also found that levels of complement C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 3 (C1QTNF3; C1QTNF3 ), a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family, were lower in individuals with AKI. This is congruent with a smaller investigation focused on diabetic patients, which reported lower serum levels of C1QTNF3 in those with type 2 diabetes when compared to healthy controls 56 . These /uniFB01 ndings are further supported by in vitro experiments demonstrating that C1QTNF3 mitigates TGF\u03b2 1-mediated kidney /uniFB01 brosis 57 and ameliorates lipid accumulation and necroin/uniFB02 ammation induced by high glucose concentrations in renal tubular cells 58 .\n\nWhile the functional signi /uniFB01 cance and potential prognostic value of these proteins remain to be fully investigated, many of them are involved in common biological pathways relevant to tubular injury such as regulation of immune and cellular stress responses. The leading pathways in our study related to cellular organelle stress including mitochondrial or endoplasmic reticulum damage. These pathways are critical in AKI onset and can also drive in /uniFB02 ammation and /uniFB01 brosis, key factors in the transition from AKI to CKD when stress is sustained 59 . In fact, several markers found in this study are markers involved in the pathogenesis of both AKI and CKD. Traditionally, ATI parameters have not been systematically assessed in biopsies obtained for CKD evaluation. It is possible, however, that the extent of ATI could serve as a valuable prognostic indicator for assessing the likelihood of transitioning from acute to chronic kidney injury, underscoring the potential bene /uniFB01 t of incorporating routine ATI assessment in CKD biopsies to enhance prognostic accuracy.\n\nSigni /uniFB01 cant strengths of our study include the large number of protein biomarkers included in the analyses. Detailed adjudicated histopathologic scores by two kidney pathologists allowed us to test associations between markers and the degree of ATI.

Our study has several limitations that warrant consideration as well. Given the intrinsic limitations of cross-sectional studies, which prevent the establishment of causality, additional experimental and clinical studies are needed to establish the causal role of the ATI biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in this study. While our study cohort underwent comprehensive phenotypic characterization, enabling extensive multivariable adjustment, we cannot exclude the potential in /uniFB02 uence of unmeasured confounding variables on our results. Our study delineates several proteins that warrant further investigation in animal models to elucidate their tissue-speci /uniFB01 c function within the kidney.\n\nIn conclusion, our proteomics study identi /uniFB01 ed over 150 proteins in the plasma of individuals with histologically con rmed tubular /uniFB01 injury, with subsequent interrogation of /uniFB01 ndings in separate cohort studies with plasma proteomics, regional proteomics, and single-cell transcriptomics.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Ethical compliance\n\nWehavecompliedwithallethical regulations related to this study. All studies included received approval from their respective institutional review boards (IRB) at each participating center which included the Mass General Brigham IRB (BKBC study), the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill IRB (ARIC Study), the Johns Hopkins University IRB (ARIC Study), the University of Minnesota IRB (ARIC Study), the University of Mississippi Medical Center IRB (ARIC Study), and the University of Washington IRB (KPMP and CHROME studies).

The study includes adults \u2265 18 years of age who underwent a clinically indicated kidney biopsy between September 2006 and October 2018. Exclusion criteria were the inability to provide written consent, severe anemia, pregnancy, and enrollment in competing studies. Details of the study design have been previously described 60 . Patients provided blood samples on the day of kidney biopsy. For this study, we evaluated 434 participants with available plasma samples. The KPMP is a multicenter prospective cohort study of people with CKD or AKI who undergo a protocol kidney biopsy at study entry as part of the KPMP consortium (https://KPMP.org) 61 . For plasma proteomics analyses, we evaluated protein measurements of 44 participants (26 with AKI and 18 who provided healthy reference tissue). The ARIC study is a prospective cohort study of individuals recruited from four US communities 62 . Participants were enrolled between 1987 and 1989, with subsequent visits in 1990 -1992 (visit 2), 1993 -1995 (visit 3), 1996 1998 -(visit 4), 2011 -2013 (visit 5), 2016 2017 -(visit 6), and 2018 2019 (visit 7), visit -8 (2020), visit 9 (2021 -2022), and visit 10 (2023). In this study, we included 4,610 participants from visit 5 who had available plasma proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling and non-missing covariates at baseline. The CHROME study is a prospective cohort study of critically ill patients admitted to three hospitals af /uniFB01 liated with the University of Washington in Seattle, WA between March 2020 and May 2021. Details of the study design have been previously described 63 . In brief, patients were eligible if admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU) with signs or symptoms of acute respiratory illness. Exclusion criteria included being under 18 years of age, incarcerated, pregnant, or undergoing chronic maintenance hemodialysis. In this study, we included 268 individuals with available SOMAScan plasma proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling. All studies included in this manuscript received approval from their respective institutional review boards at each participating center.\n\n## Sample collection and proteomics assays\n\nProteomic pro /uniFB01 ling was performed on blood samples from the baseline visit of the BKBC, KPMP, and CHROME cohort, as well as visit 5 of the ARIC study. After collection, blood samples were aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0C. The SOMAscan assay was utilized for proteomic measurements 64 . This assay employs SOMAmers (selective singlestranded deoxyoligonucleotides) for protein binding and quanti /uniFB01 es proteins based on /uniFB02 uorescence intensity, indicative of relative protein concentrations. The ARIC and CHROME plasma samples were analyzed using the SOMAscan 5k platform (approximately 5000 proteins), while the BKBC and KPMP samples were assessed using the SOMAscan 7k platform (approximately 7000 proteins). In the BKBC, 6592 aptamers passed quality control metrics and were included in subsequent analyses; the mean coef /uniFB01 cient of variation (CV) on 8 blind duplicate pairs was 4.7%. In ARIC, KPMP, and the CHROME cohort, we evaluated only those proteins that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with ATI in the BKBC (156 unique proteins). For ARIC visit 5, the mean Bland Altman coef /uniFB01 cient of variation was 6.6% from 26 samples in blind triplicate. In KPMP, the mean CVs on 2 sets of 4 blind duplicates was 4.9%. For all studies, protein aptamers were log2-transformed and winsorized at mean\u00b15\u00d7SD and adaptive normalization was performed by maximum likelihood as previously described 64 .\n\n## Histopathologic outcome\n\nIn the BKBC, kidney biopsy specimens were adjudicated under light microscopy by two experienced kidney pathologists who provided semiquantitative scores of ATI scored from 0 to 3 re /uniFB02 ecting none, mild, moderate, and severe lesion severity. Methods to evaluate and score histopathologic lesion severity were previously described in detail 60 . The weighted kappa statistic (95% CI) from 26 randomly selected biopsies for repeat review months after the initial scoring for ATI was 0.67 (0.45 -0.89) 60 . All participants ' charts were reviewed alongside histopathologic evaluations to provide the /uniFB01 nal primary clinicopathologic diagnosis.\n\n## Outcome of acute kidney injury\n\nIn KPMP, patients eligible for percutaneous kidney biopsy for AKI must have elevated serum creatinine that is either sustained or accompanied by evidence of parenchymal injury. Detailed inclusion criteria for AKI biopsies were previously described in detail 61 . In ARIC, individuals included in this study were free of AKI at baseline and followed prospectively for incident AKI. Incident cases of AKI were identi /uniFB01 ed by International Classi /uniFB01 cation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modi /uniFB01 cation (ICD-9-CM) codes 584.5 to 584.9 and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modi cation (ICD-10-CM) codes N17.0 to N17.9 or a 50% increase from /uniFB01 outpatient serum creatinine during hospitalization. ICD codes were retrieved from hospital discharge billing and death certi /uniFB01 cates 65 . In the CHROME Cohort, the primary outcome was severe AKI within 7 days, de ned by either initiation of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) or a /uniFB01 doubling of serum creatinine from ICU admission 63 . In the ARIC and CHROME studies, blood samples were collected prior to the diagnosis of AKI or severe AKI, respectively.\n\n## Covariates\n\nIn the BKBC, detailed patient information was collected at the biopsy visit, including demographics, medical history, medication lists, and pertinent laboratory data and stored using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Partners Health Care. We obtained serum creatinine (SCr) from the electronic medical record (EMR) on the day of biopsy. In participants for whom this was unavailable, we measured SCr in available blood samples collected on the day of the biopsy. We obtained spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) from the date of kidney biopsy to 3monthsbeforebiopsyfromtheEMR.Ifbothwereavailable,theUACR wasused.Ifaparticipant did not have any of thesevalues, we measured urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio from urine collected on the day of the kidney biopsy. SCr and urine creatinine were measured using a Jaffebased method and urine albumin was measured by an immunoturbidometric method. The creatinine-based Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration 2021 equation was used to calculate the eGFR 66 . In ARIC, covariates included age, sex, self-reported race, systolic blood pressure (SBP), UACR, smoking status, diabetes (fasting glucose of \u2265 126 mg/dL or non-fasting glucose level of \u2265 200mg/dL, self-reported history of diabetes diagnosed by a physician, or use of medications for diabetes), hypertension (SBP \u2265 140 mm Hg and DBP \u2265 90mm Hg, or use of medication for high BP), and eGFR (calculated using the CKD-EPI 2021 equation, which takes both serum creatinine and cystatin C into account) 66 . Serum creatinine was measured using a Roche enzymatic method (visit 5) and serum cystatin C was measured using the Roche Cobas 6000 chemistry analyzer. The UACR was calculated using urine albumin and creatinine (measured using an immunoturbidometric method on the ProSpec nephelometric analyzer and the Roche enzymatic method, respectively). In CHROME, covariates including age, sex, and COVID-19 status were extracted from the EMR.\n\n## Regional proteomics\n\nWeinvestigated the expression of ATI biomarker proteins in regional tissue proteomics from KPMP kidney biopsy samples (https://atlas. kpmp.org/explorer/regionalpro; access date: April 20, 2024). Detailed protocols and dataset information are available at https:// www.kpmp.org/help-docs/technologies. In brief, kidney tissue was laser-microdissected to isolate glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartments. Following protein extraction from targeted tissue sections, proteins were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) for comprehensive identi /uniFB01 cation and quanti /uniFB01 cation. The study included tissue samples from 31 individuals (12 with AKI, 14 with CKD, and 5 healthy controls). We analyzed and compared the expression pro /uniFB01 les of ATI biomarkers between the tubulointerstitial and glomerular\n\ncompartments across all participants, and separately, evaluated differences in tubulointerstitial protein expression between healthy controls and those with AKI.\n\n## Kidney gene expression analysis\n\nTo map biomarker proteins to gene expression data, we investigated the expression of ATI biomarker-corresponding genes using regional transcriptomics and scRNA-seq data from KPMP (https://atlas.kpmp. org/explorer; access date: August 1, 2023). Tissue samples used for regional transcriptomics were drawn from living donor biopsy participants and used to compare expression (Fold Change) of our ATI biomarker genes of interest in the tubulointerstitium ( n =36; 9 healthy reference, 22 CKD, 5 AKI). Tissue samples analyzed using scRNA-seq were drawn from 47 participants (12 with AKI, 15 with CKD, and 20 healthy controls) and used to test for differential gene expression in kidney cell types. Details on these datasets have been described previously 67,68 .\n\n## Pathway analysis\n\nTo obtain basic functional information on biomarker proteins that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with ATI severity and to investigate potentially relevant biological pathways, we applied Pathway Enrichment Analysis using gene sets obtained from publicly available databases including Gene Ontology, KEGG, and Reactome 69,70 . We ranked proteins based on their strength of association with ATI. We then calculated normalized enrichment scores to identify pathways with signi /uniFB01 cant overrepresentation of ATI biomarkers. The Benjamini -Hochbergapproachwas employed to account for multiple testings and used to rank pathways based on the obtained p -value. Analyses were performed using the R package fgsea.\n\n## Statistical analysis\n\nWe summarized descriptive statistics as count with percentages for categorical variables and mean \u00b1 standard deviation or median with interquartile range for continuous variables. For skewed data distributions, we performed logarithmic transformation as appropriate. In the BKBC, multivariable linear regression models were used to assess associations of each plasma biomarker protein with ATI severity. In these models, the ATI severity score was used as the independent variable and each log2-transformed biomarker as the dependent variable. The adjusted model included the covariates age, race, sex, and eGFR. A prespeci /uniFB01 ed \u03b1 level of 7.58\u00d710 -6 set by Bonferroni correction (0.05/6592 proteins) was used to determine statistical signi /uniFB01 cance. In ARIC, we used Cox proportional hazards models to test associations between the ATI biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in the BKBC and the outcome of incident AKI. Models were adjusted for age, sex, selfreported race, SBP, smoking status, diabetes, hypertension UACR, and eGFR. In KPMP, we compared plasma levels of the ATI biomarkers in individuals with AKI and healthy controls using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). In the CHROME cohort, we explored associations between the ATI biomarkers and severe AKI within 7 days of ICU admission using logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and COVID-19 status. In KPMP, we used a Bonferroni-corrected signi /uniFB01 cance threshold of p &lt;3.21 \u00d7 10 -4 (0.05/156 proteins). In ARIC and CHROME, we adjusted this threshold to p &lt;4.1 \u00d7 10 -4 (0.05/122 proteins) and p &lt;3.79 \u00d7 10 -4 (0.05/132 proteins), respectively, re /uniFB02 ecting that only measurements of 122 (ARIC) and 132 (CHROME) of the 156 ATI biomarkerswereavailable. In other analyses, we considered a two-sided p -value &lt; 0.05 statistically signi /uniFB01 cant. Statistical analyses were performed using R Version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and STATA 18.0 (STATACorp, College Station, TX).\n\n## Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAccess to ARIC data follows NIH data sharing policies.

Acute tubular ' injury (ATI) is observed across various types of kidney diseases and may signi /uniFB01 cantly contribute to progression to kidney failure. Non-invasive biomarkers of ATI may allow for early detection and drug development. Using the SomaScanproteomics platform on 434 patients with biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmedkidney disease, we here identify plasma biomarkers associated with ATI severity. We employ regional transcriptomics and proteomics, single-cell RNA sequencing, and pathway analysis to explore biomarker protein and gene expression and enriched biological pathways. Additionally, we examine ATI biomarker associations with acute kidney injury (AKI) in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) ( n =44), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study ( n =4610), and the COVID-19 Host Response and Clinical Outcomes (CHROME) study ( n =268). Our /uniFB01 ndings indicate 156 plasma proteins signi /uniFB01 cantly linked to ATI with osteopontin, macrophage mannose receptor 1, and tenascin C showing the strongest associations. Pathway analysis highlight immune regulation and organelle stress responses in ATI pathogenesis.\n\nThe tubules play a crucial role in optimal functioning of the kidneys, and their impairment is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality from conditions such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) culminating in kidney failure 1,2 . Tubular lesions on histopathology have been described across virtually all forms of chronic and acute kidney diseases. The kidney tubules comprise &gt; 60% of the kidneys cellular mass and have ' amongthehighest density of mitochondria and metabolic workloads of any cell type in the body 3,4 . The high energy requirements of the tubules result from ATP-consuming reabsorption of over 99% of /uniFB01 ltered sodium, glucose, and amino acids from the glomerular ultra /uniFB01 ltrate . Several studies suggest that kidney function decline is 3 more closely correlated with tubulointerstitial damage than glomerular injury 5 -7 .\n\nAcute tubular injury (ATI) describes a combination of pathologic /uniFB01 ndings, including tubular dilatation and epithelial /uniFB02 attening, tubular cell sloughing, and loss of nuclei, that re /uniFB02 ect the morphologic responses of the tubules to a diverse range of insults 8 10 -. ATI stands as a hallmark in the diagnosis of AKI but also manifests in the context of CKD 10 . Episodes of ATI and subsequent maladaptive repair can lead to the development and progression of CKD 2,11 . Therapies focusing on preventing or treating the consequences of ATI are lacking, but could\n\nA full list of af /uniFB01 liations appears at the end of the paper. *A list of authors and their af /uniFB01 liations appears at the end of the paper. e-mail: ischmidt@bu.edu\n\nplay key roles in preventing morbidity and mortality from various kidney diseases.\n\nSeveral studies have illustrated how large-scale proteomics approaches can identify important protein markers to prognosticate the risk of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with kidney disease 12 -18 . Few studies have used this approach to determine noninvasive correlates of kidney histopathology, which could potentially lead to the identi /uniFB01 cation of new therapeutic targets 19 .\n\nIn the present study, we used an unbiased proteomics assay to measure 6592 plasma proteins in the Boston Kidney Biopsy Cohort (BKBC), a cohort study of individuals with biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmed kidney disease and adjudicated semi-quantitative assessment of ATI. We /uniFB01 rst assessed associations of each protein biomarker with ATI severity and determined enriched pathways that may have biological relevance for ATI pathogenesis. We then investigated the expression of biomarker proteins and corresponding biomarker-genes in regional proteomics and transcriptomics as well as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from human kidney. Lastly, we explored associations between our /uniFB01 ndings and the development of AKI in three additional cohort studies with available proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling: the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, andacohortofcritically ill patients from an intensive care unit (COVID19 Host Response and Clinical Outcomes (CHROME)) study.\n\n## Results\n\nAs outlined in Fig. 1, we analyzed data from (i) individuals with biopsycon rmed ATI, (ii) individuals biopsied for AKI and healthy controls, /uniFB01 (iii) individuals from the general population at risk for developing AKI, and (iv) critically ill individuals at risk of severe AKI.\n\n## Identi /uniFB01 cation and characterization of plasma biomarkers of ATI\n\nBaseline characteristics of the BKBC study cohort are shown in Table 1. The mean age was 54\u00b1 16 years and 48% were women. The mean eGFR was 51 \u00b1 33 ml/min/1.73m 2 and the median proteinuria (IQR) was 1.4 (0.3, 3.9) g/g creatinine. The most common primary clinicopathologic diagnoses were glomerulopathies (40%), diabetic nephropathy (16%), advanced chronic changes (15%), vascular disease (12%), and tubulointerstitial disease (11%). Figure 2a shows the breakdown of ATI severity by clinicopathologic diagnosis: 53% of BKBC participants had no ATI, 30% had mild ATI, 13% had moderate ATI, and 4% had severe ATI.\n\nAssociations between plasma biomarkers and ATI severity are shown in Fig. 2b and Supplemental Data 1. After multivariable adjustment and correction for multiple testing, 156 unique proteins (170 aptamers; some proteins are measured by 2 or more aptamers) were associated with ATI. Among those, higher levels of 126 proteins and lower levels of 30 proteins were independently associated with ATI severity. Higher levels of the following plasma biomarkers were associated with greater ATI severity (top 5 /uniFB01 ndings in the order of level of signi /uniFB01 cance): osteopontin ( SPP1 ), macrophage mannose receptor 1 ( MRC-1 ), tenascin C ( TNC ), netrin-4 ( NTN4 ), and marginal zone B- and B1-cell-speci /uniFB01 c protein ( MZB1 ). The top /uniFB01 ve plasma proteins negatively associated with ATI severity were plasma serine protease inhibitor ( SERPINA5 ), cholinesterase ( BCHE ), neuropeptide S ( NPS ), kallistatin ( SERPINA4) and alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein ( AHSG ). Additional proteins associated with ATI with biological relevance in kidney disease include kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1; HACVR1 ), WAP four-disul /uniFB01 de core domainprotein2(HE4; WFDC2 ), growth/differentiation factor-15 ( GDF15 ), serum amyloid A-1 protein ( SAA1 ), and serum amyloid A-2 protein ( SAA2 ).\n\nOf the 156 ATI biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in the BKBC, 78 were analyzed within the KPMP regional proteomics dataset. Comparison with glomerular expression revealed elevated protein expression of several ATI biomarkers in the tubulointerstitium (Fig. 3a). When comparing regional protein expression between individuals with AKI and healthy controls, we observed protein expression of eight ATI biomarkers. All except one (apolipoprotein A-1; APOA1 ) showed protein expression in direction concordant with greater ATI severity as observed in Study 1 (BKBC). We observed protein expression of our top ATI biomarker /uniFB01 ndings, osteopontin ( SPP1 ), macrophage mannose receptor 1 ( MRC-1 ), and tenascin C ( TNC ), in the tubulointersitium of kidneys with AKI (Fig. 3b). Utilizing regional transcriptomics data, 42 of the 156 ATI biomarkers were found to be expressed in kidney tubules, 29 of which showed higher tubular compared to glomerular expression. We observed the highest tubular expression for WFDC2, GDF15 , and SPP1 when compared to glomerular expression (Fig. 3c). Detailed expression of these three markers in different kidney cell types is shown in Supplemental Fig. 1. We observed prominent expression of WFDC2, GDF15 , and SPP1 in cell clusters of the thick ascending limb. SPP1 was also strongly expressed in distal convoluted tubule cell clusters, while GDF15 and WFDC2 expression was prominent in clusters of connecting tubule cells.\n\nOf the 156 unique proteins linked to ATI, several play roles in the regulation of the immune system and intracellular pathways. We identi /uniFB01 ed seven key pathways (all p &lt;0.05) with relevance for ATI pathogenesis. Of these, the top-ranked pathways were: ' Intracellular Organelle Lumen, ' ' Endoplasmic Reticulum Lumen, and ' ' Immune System ' (Fig. 3d). Additional pathways that had immunoregulatory capacities included ' Interactions Between Lymphoid and NonLymphoid Cells ' and Neutrophil Degranulation. ' ' Proteins involved in these pathways included several cytokines, interleukins, members of the TNF receptor superfamily, and regulators of the complement cascade (Supplemental Data 2).\n\n## Difference of ATI biomarker levels in individuals with AKI and healthy controls\n\nIn the KPMP study, we analyzed plasma concentrations of the 156 ATI biomarkers comparing individuals with AKI to healthy subjects. After Bonferroni correction, 93 unique ATI biomarkers had signi /uniFB01 cantly different plasma levels in AKI vs. healthy plasma (Fig. 4a). Of those, 77 ATI biomarkers were elevated and 16 were lower in individuals with AKI. The direction of these changes in all 93 biomarkers was consistent with the observations made in the BKBC (Fig. 4d). We observed the largest differences comparing AKI to healthy plasma levels for kidney injury molecule-1 ( HACVR1 ), WAP four-disul /uniFB01 de core domain protein 2 ( WFDC2 ), and growth/differentiation factor-15 ( GDF-15 ).\n\n## Associations of ATI biomarkers with incident AKI\n\nThe baseline characteristics of ARIC participants are shown in Supplemental Data 3. Over a median of 6.8 years, 1084 ARIC participants developedAKI. Of the 156 unique proteins identi /uniFB01 edasATIbiomarkers in Study 1 (BKBC), 122 proteins were measured in ARIC. Of those, 35 were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with higher risks and 10 with lower risks of incident AKI after multivariable adjustment (Fig. 4b and Supplemental Data 4). The direction of these associations was found to be consistent (Fig. 4d): the same 35 proteins associated with elevated risks of AKI in ARIC were also linked to more severe ATI in the BKBC. Among those were osteopontin ( SPP1 ), tenascin C ( TNC ), as well as WAP fourdisul /uniFB01 de core domain protein 2 (HE4; WFDC2 ) and growth/differentiation factor-15 ( GDF-15 ). Similarly, the 10 proteins associated with lower risks of AKI in ARIC corresponded to less severe ATI in the BKBC (Fig. 4d).\n\n## Associations of ATI biomarkers with severe AKI\n\nAmong the 268 critically ill patients enrolled into the CHROME study, 34 developed severe AKI on day 7 after ICU admission (Supplemental Data5). Of the previously identi /uniFB01 edATIbiomarkers,38uniquemarkers were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with severe AKI after adjustment for age, sex, and COVID-19 status. Of those, 36 were associated with higher risks and 2 with lower risks of severe AKI (Fig. 4c, d, and Supplemental\n\nFig. 1 | Outline of studies, study participants, and primary outcomes.

These included osteopontin ( SPP1 ), tenascin C ( TNC ), and mannose-binding lectin 2 ( LMAN2 ), among others (Fig. 4d).\n\nAdditionally, we expanded our investigation to examine associations betweenour /uniFB01 ndingsandthedevelopmentorprognosisofAKIinthree distinct cohorts with available proteomic data.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis study provides an assessment of the plasma proteome in a cohort of individuals with biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmed ATI followed by further study of the proteomic results in external cohorts. We identi /uniFB01 ed biomarkers of ATI severity, assessed their tubular expression, and conducted pathway enrichment analyses that highlighted immune regulation and organelle stress responses as central mechanisms in ATI pathogenesis.\n\nPrevious proteomics research has mainly centered on analyzing the plasma proteome to assess risks of adverse clinical outcomes in individuals with kidney disease 18,20 -22 . Fewer studies have utilized proteomics to interrogate associations between circulating proteins and kidney histopathologic changes including ATI 19,23,24 . Kidney tubular injury can lead to a signi /uniFB01 cant decrease in kidney function. While it is commonlylinked to the clinical syndrome of AKI, it may also in /uniFB02 uence the onset and progression of CKD 25 . Someof the individual proteins we investigated have previously been identi /uniFB01 ed to be associated with ATI. Among those, plasma KIM-1 stands as the most extensively studied marker 12,26 . In prior studies using both ELISA and proximity extension assay (Olink platform) 27 , we observed consistent associations of\n\nTable 1 | Baseline characteristics of BKBC participants\n\n| Baseline characteristics            | n = 434         |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Clinical characteristics            |                 |\n| Age, years                          | 54.4 \u00b1 16.2     |\n| Female                              | 206 (47.5)      |\n| Race                                |                 |\n| White                               | 286 (66.2)      |\n| Black                               | 87 (20.1)       |\n| Other                               | 59 (13.7)       |\n| eGFR, ml/min/1.73m 2                | 50.8 \u00b1 33.2     |\n| Proteinuria, g/g creatinine         | 1.4 [0.3 - 3.9] |\n| Reason for biopsy *                 |                 |\n| Proteinuria                         | 231 (53.2)      |\n| Hematuria                           | 107 (24.7)      |\n| Nephrotic syndrome                  | 50 (11.5)       |\n| Nephritic syndrome                  | 8 (1.8)         |\n| Abnormal eGFR/Other                 | 300 (69.1)      |\n| Primary clinicopathologic diagnosis |                 |\n| Proliferative glomerulonephritis    | 111 (25.6)      |\n| Diabetic nephropathy                | 68 (15.7)       |\n| Non-proliferative glomerulopathy    | 62 (14.3)       |\n| Advanced chronic changes            | 63 (14.5)       |\n| Vascular disease                    | 52 (12.0)       |\n| Tubulointerstitial disease          | 48 (11.1)       |\n| Other                               | 30 (6.9)        |\n| Co-morbid conditions                |                 |\n| Hypertension                        | 256 (59.0)      |\n| Diabetes mellitus                   | 126 (29.0)      |\n| Systemic vasculitis                 | 11 (2.5)        |\n| Systemic Lupus Erythematosus        | 8 (1.8)         |\n| Hepatitis B                         | 4 (0.9)         |\n| Hepatitis C                         | 11 (2.5)        |\n| Malignancy                          | 64 (14.7)       |\n| HIV                                 | 4 (0.9)         |\n| Solid organ transplant (non-renal)  | 14 (3.2)        |\n| Medications                         |                 |\n| ACEi                                | 131 (30.2)      |\n| ARB                                 | 70 (16.1)       |\n| MRA                                 | 11 (2.5)        |\n| Calcium channel blockers            | 120 (27.6)      |\n| Beta-blockers                       | 156 (35.9)      |\n| Immunosuppression                   | 48 (11.1)       |\n| Corticosteroids                     | 68 (15.7)       |\n\nData presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, median [IQR] and count with frequencies (%) for binary and categorical variables.

Many other /uniFB01 ndings from the present study unveil new insights that may pave the foundation for future investigation.\n\nThe biomarker most strongly associated with more severe ATI was osteopontin (OPN; SPP1 ). OPN is a 44 kD glycoprotein predominantly secreted in bone and epithelial tissues. In the kidney, expression increases during injury 29,30 . Recent mechanistic studies have identi /uniFB01 ed circulating OPN derived from kidney tubule cells as a key mediator of AKI-induced acute lung injury 31 . Another study showed that plasma OPN levels in individuals recovering from AKI\n\nwere signi /uniFB01 cantly higher when compared to individuals with irreversible loss of kidney function after AKI 32 . In the setting of CKD, higher serum OPN levels were associated with worse kidney function and greater risk of kidney failure and death 33 . Our results provide further evidence for a strong association of OPN with tubular injury and suggest its potential as a speci /uniFB01 c tool to assess for the degree of ATI. Similarly, we found a consistent relationship between higher tenascin C (TNC; TNC ) levels, more severe ATI, and greater risk of AKI across cohorts. TNC, an extracellular matrix protein, is upregulated in the tubulointerstitium of CKD patients and has been shown to be involved in the transition from AKI to CKD by impairing tubular integrity through \u03b1 \u03b2 v 6 integrin signaling 34 .\n\nWe also observed strong associations between ATI severity and human epididymis protein-4 (HE4; WFDC2 ) and growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15; GDF-15 ). Both markers had higher levels in AKI, were associated with incident AKI, and were also among the top markers expressed in kidney tubules. HE4 is a serine protease inhibitor that has recently been shown to promote kidney /uniFB01 brosis by inhibiting the degradation of type I collagen 35 . Studies also found a positive correlation between higher HE4 levels and more severe kidney /uniFB01 brosis 36,37 . A prior investigation in diabetic kidney disease demonstrated that higher HE4 levels associated with increased risks of future kidney function decline 38 . Our study adds that HE4 may play an important role in the development of ATI. Additionally, the upregulation of this marker in both CKD (as shown in prior studies) and AKI underscores the interconnectedness between the two conditions and may provide additional evidence for the importance of kidney tubular injury in CKD progression 12,13,26,39 .\n\nGDF-15 is a member of the TGF\u03b2 superfamily and has recently been described as a marker of oxidative stress in mitochondrial diseases 40,41 . In the kidney, GDF-15 exhibits a range of functions that are variably antagonistic or complementary, contingent upon the cellular state and surrounding microenvironment 42 45 -. While some studies have found a potentially nephroprotective role for GDF-15 through the regulation of tubular Klotho expression 43 and downregulation of in /uniFB02 ammatory activities 45 48 -, elevated levels of circulating and urinary GDF-15 have been linked to increased risks of incident CKD, CKD progression, and death in individuals with kidney disease 44,45 , as well as higher risk of cardio-renal outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes 49 . After ischemia-reperfusion injury, GDF-15-de /uniFB01 cient mice had more severe ATI whereas recombinant GDF-15 attenuated kidney injury 50 . It is possible that in patients with kidney disease, GDF-15 levels may not have a pathogenic role but rather re /uniFB02 ect a compensatory response to acute or chronic injury that is present in the setting of oxidative stress. To our knowledge, this is the /uniFB01 rst study to investigate the association between biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmed ATI and GDF-15 in a large cohort of individuals with a diverse spectrum of kidney diseases. The observed association between higher GDF-15-levels and more severe ATI may yield further con rmation for the central /uniFB01 role of mitochondrial dysfunction in acute and chronic kidney disease where GDF-15 may act as an important mediator of mitochondrial stress responses 41 .\n\nAnother ATI marker associated with AKI across all cohort studies was LMAN2, which has been previously shown by Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses to be causally associated with kidney function. LMAN2, a protein also known as vesicular integral-membrane protein (VIP36), is implicated in transport processes and metabolic activities occurring on the apical surface of kidney epithelial cells 51 . Prior studies have demonstrated that LMAN2 correlates with albuminuria and is associated with kidney function decline 51,52 . A number of biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in this study, especially those with previously demonstrated signi /uniFB01 cant MR /uniFB01 ndings, merit additional evaluation for their therapeutic potential in a range of kidney diseases.\n\nWe found lower levels of seven plasma proteins to be associated with more severe ATI that were also signi /uniFB01 cantly lower in individuals\n\nFig. 2 | Acute tubular injury (ATI) scores and identi /uniFB01 cation of ATI biomarkers. a Distribution of semiquantitative severity scores for ATI by clinicopathologic diagnostic category in the Boston Kidney Biopsy Cohort (BKBC), Study 1. b Circulating plasma proteins associated with ATI severity in native kidney biopsy specimens.

Amongthosewasplasmakallikrein ( KLKB1 ), a serine protease inhibitor implicated in coagulation and blood pressure regulation 53 . Concordant with our observations, another investigation in type 1 diabetes revealed that plasma kallikrein activity decreased in more advanced stages of diabetic nephropathy, reaching its lowest levels in individuals undergoing dialysis 54 . Additionally, a recent genome-wide association study in the German CKD Study on OPN revealed a signi /uniFB01 cant association at a locus within KLKB1 , suggesting a potential link between OPN and the kallikrein-kinin system 55 . We also found that levels of complement C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 3 (C1QTNF3; C1QTNF3 ), a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family, were lower in individuals with AKI. This is congruent with a smaller investigation focused on diabetic patients, which reported lower serum levels of C1QTNF3 in those with type 2 diabetes when compared to healthy controls 56 . These /uniFB01 ndings are further supported by in vitro experiments demonstrating that C1QTNF3 mitigates TGF\u03b2 1-mediated kidney /uniFB01 brosis 57 and ameliorates lipid accumulation and necroin/uniFB02 ammation induced by high glucose concentrations in renal tubular cells 58 .\n\nWhile the functional signi /uniFB01 cance and potential prognostic value of these proteins remain to be fully investigated, many of them are involved in common biological pathways relevant to tubular injury such as regulation of immune and cellular stress responses. The leading pathways in our study related to cellular organelle stress including mitochondrial or endoplasmic reticulum damage. These pathways are critical in AKI onset and can also drive in /uniFB02 ammation and /uniFB01 brosis, key factors in the transition from AKI to CKD when stress is sustained 59 . In fact, several markers found in this study are markers involved in the pathogenesis of both AKI and CKD. Traditionally, ATI parameters have not been systematically assessed in biopsies obtained for CKD evaluation. It is possible, however, that the extent of ATI could serve as a valuable prognostic indicator for assessing the likelihood of transitioning from acute to chronic kidney injury, underscoring the potential bene /uniFB01 t of incorporating routine ATI assessment in CKD biopsies to enhance prognostic accuracy.\n\nSigni /uniFB01 cant strengths of our study include the large number of protein biomarkers included in the analyses. Detailed adjudicated histopathologic scores by two kidney pathologists allowed us to test associations between markers and the degree of ATI.

Our study has several limitations that warrant consideration as well. Given the intrinsic limitations of cross-sectional studies, which prevent the establishment of causality, additional experimental and clinical studies are needed to establish the causal role of the ATI biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in this study. While our study cohort underwent comprehensive phenotypic characterization, enabling extensive multivariable adjustment, we cannot exclude the potential in /uniFB02 uence of unmeasured confounding variables on our results. Our study delineates several proteins that warrant further investigation in animal models to elucidate their tissue-speci /uniFB01 c function within the kidney.\n\nIn conclusion, our proteomics study identi /uniFB01 ed over 150 proteins in the plasma of individuals with histologically con rmed tubular /uniFB01 injury, with subsequent interrogation of /uniFB01 ndings in separate cohort studies with plasma proteomics, regional proteomics, and single-cell transcriptomics.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Ethical compliance\n\nWehavecompliedwithallethical regulations related to this study. All studies included received approval from their respective institutional review boards (IRB) at each participating center which included the Mass General Brigham IRB (BKBC study), the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill IRB (ARIC Study), the Johns Hopkins University IRB (ARIC Study), the University of Minnesota IRB (ARIC Study), the University of Mississippi Medical Center IRB (ARIC Study), and the University of Washington IRB (KPMP and CHROME studies). Informed consent was obtained from participants of the BKBC, ARIC, and KPMP studies. In the CHROME study, participants were enrolled under an IRB-approved waiver of informed consent. All studies were conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n## Study populations\n\nThe BKBC is a prospective, observational cohort study of patients who underwent native kidney biopsy at three tertiary care hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts, including Brigham and Womens Hospital, ' Massachusetts General Hospital, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical\n\nFig. 3 | Expression of acute tubular injury (ATI) biomarkers in regional proteomics and transcriptomics data and pathway analysis. a ATI biomarkers with elevated protein expression comparing tubulointerstitial to glomerular levels in KPMPregionalproteomicsdata(AKI, CKD,HRT combined). b Protein expression of ATI biomarkers in the tubulointerstitium of individuals with AKI compared to healthy controls using Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test and Benjamini -Hochberg FDR to account for multiple comparisons.

The study includes adults \u2265 18 years of age who underwent a clinically indicated kidney biopsy between September 2006 and October 2018. Exclusion criteria were the inability to provide written consent, severe anemia, pregnancy, and enrollment in competing studies. Details of the study design have been previously described 60 . Patients provided blood samples on the day of kidney biopsy. For this study, we evaluated 434 participants with available plasma samples. The KPMP is a multicenter prospective cohort study of people with CKD or AKI who undergo a protocol kidney biopsy at study entry as part of the KPMP consortium (https://KPMP.org) 61 . For plasma proteomics analyses, we evaluated protein measurements of 44 participants (26 with AKI and 18 who provided healthy reference tissue). The ARIC study is a prospective cohort study of individuals recruited from four US communities 62 . Participants were enrolled between 1987 and 1989, with subsequent visits in 1990 -1992 (visit 2), 1993 -1995 (visit 3), 1996 1998 -(visit 4), 2011 -2013 (visit 5), 2016 2017 -(visit 6), and 2018 2019 (visit 7), visit -8 (2020), visit 9 (2021 -2022), and visit 10 (2023). In this study, we included 4,610 participants from visit 5 who had available plasma proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling and non-missing covariates at baseline. The CHROME study is a prospective cohort study of critically ill patients admitted to three hospitals af /uniFB01 liated with the University of Washington in Seattle, WA between March 2020 and May 2021. Details of the study design have been previously described 63 . In brief, patients were eligible if admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU) with signs or symptoms of acute respiratory illness. Exclusion criteria included being under 18 years of age, incarcerated, pregnant, or undergoing chronic maintenance hemodialysis. In this study, we included 268 individuals with available SOMAScan plasma proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling. All studies included in this manuscript received approval from their respective institutional review boards at each participating center.\n\n## Sample collection and proteomics assays\n\nProteomic pro /uniFB01 ling was performed on blood samples from the baseline visit of the BKBC, KPMP, and CHROME cohort, as well as visit 5 of the ARIC study. After collection, blood samples were aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0C. The SOMAscan assay was utilized for proteomic measurements 64 . This assay employs SOMAmers (selective singlestranded deoxyoligonucleotides) for protein binding and quanti /uniFB01 es proteins based on /uniFB02 uorescence intensity, indicative of relative protein concentrations. The ARIC and CHROME plasma samples were analyzed using the SOMAscan 5k platform (approximately 5000 proteins), while the BKBC and KPMP samples were assessed using the SOMAscan 7k platform (approximately 7000 proteins). In the BKBC, 6592 aptamers passed quality control metrics and were included in subsequent analyses; the mean coef /uniFB01 cient of variation (CV) on 8 blind duplicate pairs was 4.7%. In ARIC, KPMP, and the CHROME cohort, we evaluated only those proteins that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with ATI in the BKBC (156 unique proteins). For ARIC visit 5, the mean Bland Altman coef /uniFB01 cient of variation was 6.6% from 26 samples in blind triplicate. In KPMP, the mean CVs on 2 sets of 4 blind duplicates was 4.9%. For all studies, protein aptamers were log2-transformed and winsorized at mean\u00b15\u00d7SD and adaptive normalization was performed by maximum likelihood as previously described 64 .\n\n## Histopathologic outcome\n\nIn the BKBC, kidney biopsy specimens were adjudicated under light microscopy by two experienced kidney pathologists who provided semiquantitative scores of ATI scored from 0 to 3 re /uniFB02 ecting none, mild, moderate, and severe lesion severity. Methods to evaluate and score histopathologic lesion severity were previously described in detail 60 . The weighted kappa statistic (95% CI) from 26 randomly selected biopsies for repeat review months after the initial scoring for ATI was 0.67 (0.45 -0.89) 60 . All participants ' charts were reviewed alongside histopathologic evaluations to provide the /uniFB01 nal primary clinicopathologic diagnosis.\n\n## Outcome of acute kidney injury\n\nIn KPMP, patients eligible for percutaneous kidney biopsy for AKI must have elevated serum creatinine that is either sustained or accompanied by evidence of parenchymal injury. Detailed inclusion criteria for AKI biopsies were previously described in detail 61 . In ARIC, individuals included in this study were free of AKI at baseline and followed prospectively for incident AKI. Incident cases of AKI were identi /uniFB01 ed by International Classi /uniFB01 cation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modi /uniFB01 cation (ICD-9-CM) codes 584.5 to 584.9 and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modi cation (ICD-10-CM) codes N17.0 to N17.9 or a 50% increase from /uniFB01 outpatient serum creatinine during hospitalization. ICD codes were retrieved from hospital discharge billing and death certi /uniFB01 cates 65 . In the CHROME Cohort, the primary outcome was severe AKI within 7 days, de ned by either initiation of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) or a /uniFB01 doubling of serum creatinine from ICU admission 63 . In the ARIC and CHROME studies, blood samples were collected prior to the diagnosis of AKI or severe AKI, respectively.\n\n## Covariates\n\nIn the BKBC, detailed patient information was collected at the biopsy visit, including demographics, medical history, medication lists, and pertinent laboratory data and stored using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Partners Health Care. We obtained serum creatinine (SCr) from the electronic medical record (EMR) on the day of biopsy. In participants for whom this was unavailable, we measured SCr in available blood samples collected on the day of the biopsy. We obtained spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) from the date of kidney biopsy to 3monthsbeforebiopsyfromtheEMR.Ifbothwereavailable,theUACR wasused.Ifaparticipant did not have any of thesevalues, we measured urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio from urine collected on the day of the kidney biopsy. SCr and urine creatinine were measured using a Jaffebased method and urine albumin was measured by an immunoturbidometric method. The creatinine-based Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration 2021 equation was used to calculate the eGFR 66 . In ARIC, covariates included age, sex, self-reported race, systolic blood pressure (SBP), UACR, smoking status, diabetes (fasting glucose of \u2265 126 mg/dL or non-fasting glucose level of \u2265 200mg/dL, self-reported history of diabetes diagnosed by a physician, or use of medications for diabetes), hypertension (SBP \u2265 140 mm Hg and DBP \u2265 90mm Hg, or use of medication for high BP), and eGFR (calculated using the CKD-EPI 2021 equation, which takes both serum creatinine and cystatin C into account) 66 . Serum creatinine was measured using a Roche enzymatic method (visit 5) and serum cystatin C was measured using the Roche Cobas 6000 chemistry analyzer. The UACR was calculated using urine albumin and creatinine (measured using an immunoturbidometric method on the ProSpec nephelometric analyzer and the Roche enzymatic method, respectively). In CHROME, covariates including age, sex, and COVID-19 status were extracted from the EMR.\n\n## Regional proteomics\n\nWeinvestigated the expression of ATI biomarker proteins in regional tissue proteomics from KPMP kidney biopsy samples (https://atlas. kpmp.org/explorer/regionalpro; access date: April 20, 2024). Detailed protocols and dataset information are available at https:// www.kpmp.org/help-docs/technologies. In brief, kidney tissue was laser-microdissected to isolate glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartments. Following protein extraction from targeted tissue sections, proteins were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) for comprehensive identi /uniFB01 cation and quanti /uniFB01 cation. The study included tissue samples from 31 individuals (12 with AKI, 14 with CKD, and 5 healthy controls). We analyzed and compared the expression pro /uniFB01 les of ATI biomarkers between the tubulointerstitial and glomerular\n\ncompartments across all participants, and separately, evaluated differences in tubulointerstitial protein expression between healthy controls and those with AKI.\n\n## Kidney gene expression analysis\n\nTo map biomarker proteins to gene expression data, we investigated the expression of ATI biomarker-corresponding genes using regional transcriptomics and scRNA-seq data from KPMP (https://atlas.kpmp. org/explorer; access date: August 1, 2023). Tissue samples used for regional transcriptomics were drawn from living donor biopsy participants and used to compare expression (Fold Change) of our ATI biomarker genes of interest in the tubulointerstitium ( n =36; 9 healthy reference, 22 CKD, 5 AKI). Tissue samples analyzed using scRNA-seq were drawn from 47 participants (12 with AKI, 15 with CKD, and 20 healthy controls) and used to test for differential gene expression in kidney cell types. Details on these datasets have been described previously 67,68 .\n\n## Pathway analysis\n\nTo obtain basic functional information on biomarker proteins that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with ATI severity and to investigate potentially relevant biological pathways, we applied Pathway Enrichment Analysis using gene sets obtained from publicly available databases including Gene Ontology, KEGG, and Reactome 69,70 . We ranked proteins based on their strength of association with ATI. We then calculated normalized enrichment scores to identify pathways with signi /uniFB01 cant overrepresentation of ATI biomarkers. The Benjamini -Hochbergapproachwas employed to account for multiple testings and used to rank pathways based on the obtained p -value. Analyses were performed using the R package fgsea.\n\n## Statistical analysis\n\nWe summarized descriptive statistics as count with percentages for categorical variables and mean \u00b1 standard deviation or median with interquartile range for continuous variables. For skewed data distributions, we performed logarithmic transformation as appropriate. In the BKBC, multivariable linear regression models were used to assess associations of each plasma biomarker protein with ATI severity. In these models, the ATI severity score was used as the independent variable and each log2-transformed biomarker as the dependent variable. The adjusted model included the covariates age, race, sex, and eGFR. A prespeci /uniFB01 ed \u03b1 level of 7.58\u00d710 -6 set by Bonferroni correction (0.05/6592 proteins) was used to determine statistical signi /uniFB01 cance. In ARIC, we used Cox proportional hazards models to test associations between the ATI biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in the BKBC and the outcome of incident AKI. Models were adjusted for age, sex, selfreported race, SBP, smoking status, diabetes, hypertension UACR, and eGFR. In KPMP, we compared plasma levels of the ATI biomarkers in individuals with AKI and healthy controls using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). In the CHROME cohort, we explored associations between the ATI biomarkers and severe AKI within 7 days of ICU admission using logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and COVID-19 status. In KPMP, we used a Bonferroni-corrected signi /uniFB01 cance threshold of p &lt;3.21 \u00d7 10 -4 (0.05/156 proteins). In ARIC and CHROME, we adjusted this threshold to p &lt;4.1 \u00d7 10 -4 (0.05/122 proteins) and p &lt;3.79 \u00d7 10 -4 (0.05/132 proteins), respectively, re /uniFB02 ecting that only measurements of 122 (ARIC) and 132 (CHROME) of the 156 ATI biomarkerswereavailable. In other analyses, we considered a two-sided p -value &lt; 0.05 statistically signi /uniFB01 cant. Statistical analyses were performed using R Version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and STATA 18.0 (STATACorp, College Station, TX).\n\n## Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAccess to ARIC data follows NIH data sharing policies.

Waikar 1,2\n\nReceived: 13 February 2024\n\nAccepted: 5 August 2024\n\nCheck for updates\n\nThekidney tubules constitute two-thirds of the cells of the kidney and account for the majority of the organ s metabolic energy expenditure. Acute tubular ' injury (ATI) is observed across various types of kidney diseases and may signi /uniFB01 cantly contribute to progression to kidney failure. Non-invasive biomarkers of ATI may allow for early detection and drug development. Using the SomaScanproteomics platform on 434 patients with biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmedkidney disease, we here identify plasma biomarkers associated with ATI severity. We employ regional transcriptomics and proteomics, single-cell RNA sequencing, and pathway analysis to explore biomarker protein and gene expression and enriched biological pathways. Additionally, we examine ATI biomarker associations with acute kidney injury (AKI) in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) ( n =44), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study ( n =4610), and the COVID-19 Host Response and Clinical Outcomes (CHROME) study ( n =268). Our /uniFB01 ndings indicate 156 plasma proteins signi /uniFB01 cantly linked to ATI with osteopontin, macrophage mannose receptor 1, and tenascin C showing the strongest associations. Pathway analysis highlight immune regulation and organelle stress responses in ATI pathogenesis.\n\nThe tubules play a crucial role in optimal functioning of the kidneys, and their impairment is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality from conditions such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) culminating in kidney failure 1,2 . Tubular lesions on histopathology have been described across virtually all forms of chronic and acute kidney diseases. The kidney tubules comprise &gt; 60% of the kidneys cellular mass and have ' amongthehighest density of mitochondria and metabolic workloads of any cell type in the body 3,4 . The high energy requirements of the tubules result from ATP-consuming reabsorption of over 99% of /uniFB01 ltered sodium, glucose, and amino acids from the glomerular ultra /uniFB01 ltrate . Several studies suggest that kidney function decline is 3 more closely correlated with tubulointerstitial damage than glomerular injury 5 -7 .\n\nAcute tubular injury (ATI) describes a combination of pathologic /uniFB01 ndings, including tubular dilatation and epithelial /uniFB02 attening, tubular cell sloughing, and loss of nuclei, that re /uniFB02 ect the morphologic responses of the tubules to a diverse range of insults 8 10 -. ATI stands as a hallmark in the diagnosis of AKI but also manifests in the context of CKD 10 . Episodes of ATI and subsequent maladaptive repair can lead to the development and progression of CKD 2,11 .

Few studies have used this approach to determine noninvasive correlates of kidney histopathology, which could potentially lead to the identi /uniFB01 cation of new therapeutic targets 19 .\n\nIn the present study, we used an unbiased proteomics assay to measure 6592 plasma proteins in the Boston Kidney Biopsy Cohort (BKBC), a cohort study of individuals with biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmed kidney disease and adjudicated semi-quantitative assessment of ATI. We /uniFB01 rst assessed associations of each protein biomarker with ATI severity and determined enriched pathways that may have biological relevance for ATI pathogenesis. We then investigated the expression of biomarker proteins and corresponding biomarker-genes in regional proteomics and transcriptomics as well as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from human kidney. Lastly, we explored associations between our /uniFB01 ndings and the development of AKI in three additional cohort studies with available proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling: the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, andacohortofcritically ill patients from an intensive care unit (COVID19 Host Response and Clinical Outcomes (CHROME)) study.\n\n## Results\n\nAs outlined in Fig. 1, we analyzed data from (i) individuals with biopsycon rmed ATI, (ii) individuals biopsied for AKI and healthy controls, /uniFB01 (iii) individuals from the general population at risk for developing AKI, and (iv) critically ill individuals at risk of severe AKI.\n\n## Identi /uniFB01 cation and characterization of plasma biomarkers of ATI\n\nBaseline characteristics of the BKBC study cohort are shown in Table 1. The mean age was 54\u00b1 16 years and 48% were women. The mean eGFR was 51 \u00b1 33 ml/min/1.73m 2 and the median proteinuria (IQR) was 1.4 (0.3, 3.9) g/g creatinine. The most common primary clinicopathologic diagnoses were glomerulopathies (40%), diabetic nephropathy (16%), advanced chronic changes (15%), vascular disease (12%), and tubulointerstitial disease (11%). Figure 2a shows the breakdown of ATI severity by clinicopathologic diagnosis: 53% of BKBC participants had no ATI, 30% had mild ATI, 13% had moderate ATI, and 4% had severe ATI.\n\nAssociations between plasma biomarkers and ATI severity are shown in Fig. 2b and Supplemental Data 1. After multivariable adjustment and correction for multiple testing, 156 unique proteins (170 aptamers; some proteins are measured by 2 or more aptamers) were associated with ATI. Among those, higher levels of 126 proteins and lower levels of 30 proteins were independently associated with ATI severity. Higher levels of the following plasma biomarkers were associated with greater ATI severity (top 5 /uniFB01 ndings in the order of level of signi /uniFB01 cance): osteopontin ( SPP1 ), macrophage mannose receptor 1 ( MRC-1 ), tenascin C ( TNC ), netrin-4 ( NTN4 ), and marginal zone B- and B1-cell-speci /uniFB01 c protein ( MZB1 ). The top /uniFB01 ve plasma proteins negatively associated with ATI severity were plasma serine protease inhibitor ( SERPINA5 ), cholinesterase ( BCHE ), neuropeptide S ( NPS ), kallistatin ( SERPINA4) and alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein ( AHSG ). Additional proteins associated with ATI with biological relevance in kidney disease include kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1; HACVR1 ), WAP four-disul /uniFB01 de core domainprotein2(HE4; WFDC2 ), growth/differentiation factor-15 ( GDF15 ), serum amyloid A-1 protein ( SAA1 ), and serum amyloid A-2 protein ( SAA2 ).\n\nOf the 156 ATI biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in the BKBC, 78 were analyzed within the KPMP regional proteomics dataset. Comparison with glomerular expression revealed elevated protein expression of several ATI biomarkers in the tubulointerstitium (Fig. 3a). When comparing regional protein expression between individuals with AKI and healthy controls, we observed protein expression of eight ATI biomarkers. All except one (apolipoprotein A-1; APOA1 ) showed protein expression in direction concordant with greater ATI severity as observed in Study 1 (BKBC). We observed protein expression of our top ATI biomarker /uniFB01 ndings, osteopontin ( SPP1 ), macrophage mannose receptor 1 ( MRC-1 ), and tenascin C ( TNC ), in the tubulointersitium of kidneys with AKI (Fig. 3b). Utilizing regional transcriptomics data, 42 of the 156 ATI biomarkers were found to be expressed in kidney tubules, 29 of which showed higher tubular compared to glomerular expression. We observed the highest tubular expression for WFDC2, GDF15 , and SPP1 when compared to glomerular expression (Fig. 3c). Detailed expression of these three markers in different kidney cell types is shown in Supplemental Fig. 1. We observed prominent expression of WFDC2, GDF15 , and SPP1 in cell clusters of the thick ascending limb. SPP1 was also strongly expressed in distal convoluted tubule cell clusters, while GDF15 and WFDC2 expression was prominent in clusters of connecting tubule cells.\n\nOf the 156 unique proteins linked to ATI, several play roles in the regulation of the immune system and intracellular pathways. We identi /uniFB01 ed seven key pathways (all p &lt;0.05) with relevance for ATI pathogenesis. Of these, the top-ranked pathways were: ' Intracellular Organelle Lumen, ' ' Endoplasmic Reticulum Lumen, and ' ' Immune System ' (Fig. 3d). Additional pathways that had immunoregulatory capacities included ' Interactions Between Lymphoid and NonLymphoid Cells ' and Neutrophil Degranulation. ' ' Proteins involved in these pathways included several cytokines, interleukins, members of the TNF receptor superfamily, and regulators of the complement cascade (Supplemental Data 2).\n\n## Difference of ATI biomarker levels in individuals with AKI and healthy controls\n\nIn the KPMP study, we analyzed plasma concentrations of the 156 ATI biomarkers comparing individuals with AKI to healthy subjects. After Bonferroni correction, 93 unique ATI biomarkers had signi /uniFB01 cantly different plasma levels in AKI vs. healthy plasma (Fig. 4a). Of those, 77 ATI biomarkers were elevated and 16 were lower in individuals with AKI. The direction of these changes in all 93 biomarkers was consistent with the observations made in the BKBC (Fig. 4d). We observed the largest differences comparing AKI to healthy plasma levels for kidney injury molecule-1 ( HACVR1 ), WAP four-disul /uniFB01 de core domain protein 2 ( WFDC2 ), and growth/differentiation factor-15 ( GDF-15 ).\n\n## Associations of ATI biomarkers with incident AKI\n\nThe baseline characteristics of ARIC participants are shown in Supplemental Data 3. Over a median of 6.8 years, 1084 ARIC participants developedAKI. Of the 156 unique proteins identi /uniFB01 edasATIbiomarkers in Study 1 (BKBC), 122 proteins were measured in ARIC. Of those, 35 were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with higher risks and 10 with lower risks of incident AKI after multivariable adjustment (Fig. 4b and Supplemental Data 4). The direction of these associations was found to be consistent (Fig. 4d): the same 35 proteins associated with elevated risks of AKI in ARIC were also linked to more severe ATI in the BKBC. Among those were osteopontin ( SPP1 ), tenascin C ( TNC ), as well as WAP fourdisul /uniFB01 de core domain protein 2 (HE4; WFDC2 ) and growth/differentiation factor-15 ( GDF-15 ). Similarly, the 10 proteins associated with lower risks of AKI in ARIC corresponded to less severe ATI in the BKBC (Fig. 4d).\n\n## Associations of ATI biomarkers with severe AKI\n\nAmong the 268 critically ill patients enrolled into the CHROME study, 34 developed severe AKI on day 7 after ICU admission (Supplemental Data5). Of the previously identi /uniFB01 edATIbiomarkers,38uniquemarkers were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with severe AKI after adjustment for age, sex, and COVID-19 status. Of those, 36 were associated with higher risks and 2 with lower risks of severe AKI (Fig. 4c, d, and Supplemental\n\nFig. 1 | Outline of studies, study participants, and primary outcomes.

These included osteopontin ( SPP1 ), tenascin C ( TNC ), and mannose-binding lectin 2 ( LMAN2 ), among others (Fig. 4d).\n\nAdditionally, we expanded our investigation to examine associations betweenour /uniFB01 ndingsandthedevelopmentorprognosisofAKIinthree distinct cohorts with available proteomic data.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis study provides an assessment of the plasma proteome in a cohort of individuals with biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmed ATI followed by further study of the proteomic results in external cohorts. We identi /uniFB01 ed biomarkers of ATI severity, assessed their tubular expression, and conducted pathway enrichment analyses that highlighted immune regulation and organelle stress responses as central mechanisms in ATI pathogenesis.\n\nPrevious proteomics research has mainly centered on analyzing the plasma proteome to assess risks of adverse clinical outcomes in individuals with kidney disease 18,20 -22 . Fewer studies have utilized proteomics to interrogate associations between circulating proteins and kidney histopathologic changes including ATI 19,23,24 . Kidney tubular injury can lead to a signi /uniFB01 cant decrease in kidney function. While it is commonlylinked to the clinical syndrome of AKI, it may also in /uniFB02 uence the onset and progression of CKD 25 . Someof the individual proteins we investigated have previously been identi /uniFB01 ed to be associated with ATI. Among those, plasma KIM-1 stands as the most extensively studied marker 12,26 . In prior studies using both ELISA and proximity extension assay (Olink platform) 27 , we observed consistent associations of\n\nTable 1 | Baseline characteristics of BKBC participants\n\n| Baseline characteristics            | n = 434         |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Clinical characteristics            |                 |\n| Age, years                          | 54.4 \u00b1 16.2     |\n| Female                              | 206 (47.5)      |\n| Race                                |                 |\n| White                               | 286 (66.2)      |\n| Black                               | 87 (20.1)       |\n| Other                               | 59 (13.7)       |\n| eGFR, ml/min/1.73m 2                | 50.8 \u00b1 33.2     |\n| Proteinuria, g/g creatinine         | 1.4 [0.3 - 3.9] |\n| Reason for biopsy *                 |                 |\n| Proteinuria                         | 231 (53.2)      |\n| Hematuria                           | 107 (24.7)      |\n| Nephrotic syndrome                  | 50 (11.5)       |\n| Nephritic syndrome                  | 8 (1.8)         |\n| Abnormal eGFR/Other                 | 300 (69.1)      |\n| Primary clinicopathologic diagnosis |                 |\n| Proliferative glomerulonephritis    | 111 (25.6)      |\n| Diabetic nephropathy                | 68 (15.7)       |\n| Non-proliferative glomerulopathy    | 62 (14.3)       |\n| Advanced chronic changes            | 63 (14.5)       |\n| Vascular disease                    | 52 (12.0)       |\n| Tubulointerstitial disease          | 48 (11.1)       |\n| Other                               | 30 (6.9)        |\n| Co-morbid conditions                |                 |\n| Hypertension                        | 256 (59.0)      |\n| Diabetes mellitus                   | 126 (29.0)      |\n| Systemic vasculitis                 | 11 (2.5)        |\n| Systemic Lupus Erythematosus        | 8 (1.8)         |\n| Hepatitis B                         | 4 (0.9)         |\n| Hepatitis C                         | 11 (2.5)        |\n| Malignancy                          | 64 (14.7)       |\n| HIV                                 | 4 (0.9)         |\n| Solid organ transplant (non-renal)  | 14 (3.2)        |\n| Medications                         |                 |\n| ACEi                                | 131 (30.2)      |\n| ARB                                 | 70 (16.1)       |\n| MRA                                 | 11 (2.5)        |\n| Calcium channel blockers            | 120 (27.6)      |\n| Beta-blockers                       | 156 (35.9)      |\n| Immunosuppression                   | 48 (11.1)       |\n| Corticosteroids                     | 68 (15.7)       |\n\nData presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, median [IQR] and count with frequencies (%) for binary and categorical variables.

Many other /uniFB01 ndings from the present study unveil new insights that may pave the foundation for future investigation.\n\nThe biomarker most strongly associated with more severe ATI was osteopontin (OPN; SPP1 ). OPN is a 44 kD glycoprotein predominantly secreted in bone and epithelial tissues. In the kidney, expression increases during injury 29,30 . Recent mechanistic studies have identi /uniFB01 ed circulating OPN derived from kidney tubule cells as a key mediator of AKI-induced acute lung injury 31 . Another study showed that plasma OPN levels in individuals recovering from AKI\n\nwere signi /uniFB01 cantly higher when compared to individuals with irreversible loss of kidney function after AKI 32 . In the setting of CKD, higher serum OPN levels were associated with worse kidney function and greater risk of kidney failure and death 33 . Our results provide further evidence for a strong association of OPN with tubular injury and suggest its potential as a speci /uniFB01 c tool to assess for the degree of ATI. Similarly, we found a consistent relationship between higher tenascin C (TNC; TNC ) levels, more severe ATI, and greater risk of AKI across cohorts. TNC, an extracellular matrix protein, is upregulated in the tubulointerstitium of CKD patients and has been shown to be involved in the transition from AKI to CKD by impairing tubular integrity through \u03b1 \u03b2 v 6 integrin signaling 34 .\n\nWe also observed strong associations between ATI severity and human epididymis protein-4 (HE4; WFDC2 ) and growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15; GDF-15 ). Both markers had higher levels in AKI, were associated with incident AKI, and were also among the top markers expressed in kidney tubules. HE4 is a serine protease inhibitor that has recently been shown to promote kidney /uniFB01 brosis by inhibiting the degradation of type I collagen 35 . Studies also found a positive correlation between higher HE4 levels and more severe kidney /uniFB01 brosis 36,37 . A prior investigation in diabetic kidney disease demonstrated that higher HE4 levels associated with increased risks of future kidney function decline 38 . Our study adds that HE4 may play an important role in the development of ATI. Additionally, the upregulation of this marker in both CKD (as shown in prior studies) and AKI underscores the interconnectedness between the two conditions and may provide additional evidence for the importance of kidney tubular injury in CKD progression 12,13,26,39 .\n\nGDF-15 is a member of the TGF\u03b2 superfamily and has recently been described as a marker of oxidative stress in mitochondrial diseases 40,41 . In the kidney, GDF-15 exhibits a range of functions that are variably antagonistic or complementary, contingent upon the cellular state and surrounding microenvironment 42 45 -. While some studies have found a potentially nephroprotective role for GDF-15 through the regulation of tubular Klotho expression 43 and downregulation of in /uniFB02 ammatory activities 45 48 -, elevated levels of circulating and urinary GDF-15 have been linked to increased risks of incident CKD, CKD progression, and death in individuals with kidney disease 44,45 , as well as higher risk of cardio-renal outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes 49 . After ischemia-reperfusion injury, GDF-15-de /uniFB01 cient mice had more severe ATI whereas recombinant GDF-15 attenuated kidney injury 50 . It is possible that in patients with kidney disease, GDF-15 levels may not have a pathogenic role but rather re /uniFB02 ect a compensatory response to acute or chronic injury that is present in the setting of oxidative stress. To our knowledge, this is the /uniFB01 rst study to investigate the association between biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmed ATI and GDF-15 in a large cohort of individuals with a diverse spectrum of kidney diseases. The observed association between higher GDF-15-levels and more severe ATI may yield further con rmation for the central /uniFB01 role of mitochondrial dysfunction in acute and chronic kidney disease where GDF-15 may act as an important mediator of mitochondrial stress responses 41 .\n\nAnother ATI marker associated with AKI across all cohort studies was LMAN2, which has been previously shown by Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses to be causally associated with kidney function. LMAN2, a protein also known as vesicular integral-membrane protein (VIP36), is implicated in transport processes and metabolic activities occurring on the apical surface of kidney epithelial cells 51 . Prior studies have demonstrated that LMAN2 correlates with albuminuria and is associated with kidney function decline 51,52 . A number of biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in this study, especially those with previously demonstrated signi /uniFB01 cant MR /uniFB01 ndings, merit additional evaluation for their therapeutic potential in a range of kidney diseases.\n\nWe found lower levels of seven plasma proteins to be associated with more severe ATI that were also signi /uniFB01 cantly lower in individuals\n\nFig. 2 | Acute tubular injury (ATI) scores and identi /uniFB01 cation of ATI biomarkers. a Distribution of semiquantitative severity scores for ATI by clinicopathologic diagnostic category in the Boston Kidney Biopsy Cohort (BKBC), Study 1. b Circulating plasma proteins associated with ATI severity in native kidney biopsy specimens.

Amongthosewasplasmakallikrein ( KLKB1 ), a serine protease inhibitor implicated in coagulation and blood pressure regulation 53 . Concordant with our observations, another investigation in type 1 diabetes revealed that plasma kallikrein activity decreased in more advanced stages of diabetic nephropathy, reaching its lowest levels in individuals undergoing dialysis 54 . Additionally, a recent genome-wide association study in the German CKD Study on OPN revealed a signi /uniFB01 cant association at a locus within KLKB1 , suggesting a potential link between OPN and the kallikrein-kinin system 55 . We also found that levels of complement C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 3 (C1QTNF3; C1QTNF3 ), a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family, were lower in individuals with AKI. This is congruent with a smaller investigation focused on diabetic patients, which reported lower serum levels of C1QTNF3 in those with type 2 diabetes when compared to healthy controls 56 . These /uniFB01 ndings are further supported by in vitro experiments demonstrating that C1QTNF3 mitigates TGF\u03b2 1-mediated kidney /uniFB01 brosis 57 and ameliorates lipid accumulation and necroin/uniFB02 ammation induced by high glucose concentrations in renal tubular cells 58 .\n\nWhile the functional signi /uniFB01 cance and potential prognostic value of these proteins remain to be fully investigated, many of them are involved in common biological pathways relevant to tubular injury such as regulation of immune and cellular stress responses. The leading pathways in our study related to cellular organelle stress including mitochondrial or endoplasmic reticulum damage. These pathways are critical in AKI onset and can also drive in /uniFB02 ammation and /uniFB01 brosis, key factors in the transition from AKI to CKD when stress is sustained 59 . In fact, several markers found in this study are markers involved in the pathogenesis of both AKI and CKD. Traditionally, ATI parameters have not been systematically assessed in biopsies obtained for CKD evaluation. It is possible, however, that the extent of ATI could serve as a valuable prognostic indicator for assessing the likelihood of transitioning from acute to chronic kidney injury, underscoring the potential bene /uniFB01 t of incorporating routine ATI assessment in CKD biopsies to enhance prognostic accuracy.\n\nSigni /uniFB01 cant strengths of our study include the large number of protein biomarkers included in the analyses.

Our study has several limitations that warrant consideration as well. Given the intrinsic limitations of cross-sectional studies, which prevent the establishment of causality, additional experimental and clinical studies are needed to establish the causal role of the ATI biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in this study. While our study cohort underwent comprehensive phenotypic characterization, enabling extensive multivariable adjustment, we cannot exclude the potential in /uniFB02 uence of unmeasured confounding variables on our results. Our study delineates several proteins that warrant further investigation in animal models to elucidate their tissue-speci /uniFB01 c function within the kidney.\n\nIn conclusion, our proteomics study identi /uniFB01 ed over 150 proteins in the plasma of individuals with histologically con rmed tubular /uniFB01 injury, with subsequent interrogation of /uniFB01 ndings in separate cohort studies with plasma proteomics, regional proteomics, and single-cell transcriptomics.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Ethical compliance\n\nWehavecompliedwithallethical regulations related to this study.

The study includes adults \u2265 18 years of age who underwent a clinically indicated kidney biopsy between September 2006 and October 2018. Exclusion criteria were the inability to provide written consent, severe anemia, pregnancy, and enrollment in competing studies. Details of the study design have been previously described 60 . Patients provided blood samples on the day of kidney biopsy. For this study, we evaluated 434 participants with available plasma samples. The KPMP is a multicenter prospective cohort study of people with CKD or AKI who undergo a protocol kidney biopsy at study entry as part of the KPMP consortium (https://KPMP.org) 61 . For plasma proteomics analyses, we evaluated protein measurements of 44 participants (26 with AKI and 18 who provided healthy reference tissue). The ARIC study is a prospective cohort study of individuals recruited from four US communities 62 . Participants were enrolled between 1987 and 1989, with subsequent visits in 1990 -1992 (visit 2), 1993 -1995 (visit 3), 1996 1998 -(visit 4), 2011 -2013 (visit 5), 2016 2017 -(visit 6), and 2018 2019 (visit 7), visit -8 (2020), visit 9 (2021 -2022), and visit 10 (2023).

The CHROME study is a prospective cohort study of critically ill patients admitted to three hospitals af /uniFB01 liated with the University of Washington in Seattle, WA between March 2020 and May 2021. Details of the study design have been previously described 63 . In brief, patients were eligible if admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU) with signs or symptoms of acute respiratory illness. Exclusion criteria included being under 18 years of age, incarcerated, pregnant, or undergoing chronic maintenance hemodialysis. In this study, we included 268 individuals with available SOMAScan plasma proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling. All studies included in this manuscript received approval from their respective institutional review boards at each participating center.\n\n## Sample collection and proteomics assays\n\nProteomic pro /uniFB01 ling was performed on blood samples from the baseline visit of the BKBC, KPMP, and CHROME cohort, as well as visit 5 of the ARIC study. After collection, blood samples were aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0C. The SOMAscan assay was utilized for proteomic measurements 64 . This assay employs SOMAmers (selective singlestranded deoxyoligonucleotides) for protein binding and quanti /uniFB01 es proteins based on /uniFB02 uorescence intensity, indicative of relative protein concentrations. The ARIC and CHROME plasma samples were analyzed using the SOMAscan 5k platform (approximately 5000 proteins), while the BKBC and KPMP samples were assessed using the SOMAscan 7k platform (approximately 7000 proteins). In the BKBC, 6592 aptamers passed quality control metrics and were included in subsequent analyses; the mean coef /uniFB01 cient of variation (CV) on 8 blind duplicate pairs was 4.7%. In ARIC, KPMP, and the CHROME cohort, we evaluated only those proteins that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with ATI in the BKBC (156 unique proteins). For ARIC visit 5, the mean Bland Altman coef /uniFB01 cient of variation was 6.6% from 26 samples in blind triplicate. In KPMP, the mean CVs on 2 sets of 4 blind duplicates was 4.9%. For all studies, protein aptamers were log2-transformed and winsorized at mean\u00b15\u00d7SD and adaptive normalization was performed by maximum likelihood as previously described 64 .\n\n## Histopathologic outcome\n\nIn the BKBC, kidney biopsy specimens were adjudicated under light microscopy by two experienced kidney pathologists who provided semiquantitative scores of ATI scored from 0 to 3 re /uniFB02 ecting none, mild, moderate, and severe lesion severity. Methods to evaluate and score histopathologic lesion severity were previously described in detail 60 . The weighted kappa statistic (95% CI) from 26 randomly selected biopsies for repeat review months after the initial scoring for ATI was 0.67 (0.45 -0.89) 60 . All participants ' charts were reviewed alongside histopathologic evaluations to provide the /uniFB01 nal primary clinicopathologic diagnosis.\n\n## Outcome of acute kidney injury\n\nIn KPMP, patients eligible for percutaneous kidney biopsy for AKI must have elevated serum creatinine that is either sustained or accompanied by evidence of parenchymal injury. Detailed inclusion criteria for AKI biopsies were previously described in detail 61 . In ARIC, individuals included in this study were free of AKI at baseline and followed prospectively for incident AKI. Incident cases of AKI were identi /uniFB01 ed by International Classi /uniFB01 cation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modi /uniFB01 cation (ICD-9-CM) codes 584.5 to 584.9 and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modi cation (ICD-10-CM) codes N17.0 to N17.9 or a 50% increase from /uniFB01 outpatient serum creatinine during hospitalization. ICD codes were retrieved from hospital discharge billing and death certi /uniFB01 cates 65 . In the CHROME Cohort, the primary outcome was severe AKI within 7 days, de ned by either initiation of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) or a /uniFB01 doubling of serum creatinine from ICU admission 63 . In the ARIC and CHROME studies, blood samples were collected prior to the diagnosis of AKI or severe AKI, respectively.\n\n## Covariates\n\nIn the BKBC, detailed patient information was collected at the biopsy visit, including demographics, medical history, medication lists, and pertinent laboratory data and stored using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Partners Health Care. We obtained serum creatinine (SCr) from the electronic medical record (EMR) on the day of biopsy. In participants for whom this was unavailable, we measured SCr in available blood samples collected on the day of the biopsy. We obtained spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) from the date of kidney biopsy to 3monthsbeforebiopsyfromtheEMR.Ifbothwereavailable,theUACR wasused.Ifaparticipant did not have any of thesevalues, we measured urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio from urine collected on the day of the kidney biopsy. SCr and urine creatinine were measured using a Jaffebased method and urine albumin was measured by an immunoturbidometric method. The creatinine-based Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration 2021 equation was used to calculate the eGFR 66 . In ARIC, covariates included age, sex, self-reported race, systolic blood pressure (SBP), UACR, smoking status, diabetes (fasting glucose of \u2265 126 mg/dL or non-fasting glucose level of \u2265 200mg/dL, self-reported history of diabetes diagnosed by a physician, or use of medications for diabetes), hypertension (SBP \u2265 140 mm Hg and DBP \u2265 90mm Hg, or use of medication for high BP), and eGFR (calculated using the CKD-EPI 2021 equation, which takes both serum creatinine and cystatin C into account) 66 . Serum creatinine was measured using a Roche enzymatic method (visit 5) and serum cystatin C was measured using the Roche Cobas 6000 chemistry analyzer. The UACR was calculated using urine albumin and creatinine (measured using an immunoturbidometric method on the ProSpec nephelometric analyzer and the Roche enzymatic method, respectively). In CHROME, covariates including age, sex, and COVID-19 status were extracted from the EMR.\n\n## Regional proteomics\n\nWeinvestigated the expression of ATI biomarker proteins in regional tissue proteomics from KPMP kidney biopsy samples (https://atlas. kpmp.org/explorer/regionalpro; access date: April 20, 2024). Detailed protocols and dataset information are available at https:// www.kpmp.org/help-docs/technologies. In brief, kidney tissue was laser-microdissected to isolate glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartments. Following protein extraction from targeted tissue sections, proteins were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) for comprehensive identi /uniFB01 cation and quanti /uniFB01 cation. The study included tissue samples from 31 individuals (12 with AKI, 14 with CKD, and 5 healthy controls). We analyzed and compared the expression pro /uniFB01 les of ATI biomarkers between the tubulointerstitial and glomerular\n\ncompartments across all participants, and separately, evaluated differences in tubulointerstitial protein expression between healthy controls and those with AKI.\n\n## Kidney gene expression analysis\n\nTo map biomarker proteins to gene expression data, we investigated the expression of ATI biomarker-corresponding genes using regional transcriptomics and scRNA-seq data from KPMP (https://atlas.kpmp. org/explorer; access date: August 1, 2023). Tissue samples used for regional transcriptomics were drawn from living donor biopsy participants and used to compare expression (Fold Change) of our ATI biomarker genes of interest in the tubulointerstitium ( n =36; 9 healthy reference, 22 CKD, 5 AKI). Tissue samples analyzed using scRNA-seq were drawn from 47 participants (12 with AKI, 15 with CKD, and 20 healthy controls) and used to test for differential gene expression in kidney cell types. Details on these datasets have been described previously 67,68 .\n\n## Pathway analysis\n\nTo obtain basic functional information on biomarker proteins that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with ATI severity and to investigate potentially relevant biological pathways, we applied Pathway Enrichment Analysis using gene sets obtained from publicly available databases including Gene Ontology, KEGG, and Reactome 69,70 . We ranked proteins based on their strength of association with ATI. We then calculated normalized enrichment scores to identify pathways with signi /uniFB01 cant overrepresentation of ATI biomarkers. The Benjamini -Hochbergapproachwas employed to account for multiple testings and used to rank pathways based on the obtained p -value. Analyses were performed using the R package fgsea.\n\n## Statistical analysis\n\nWe summarized descriptive statistics as count with percentages for categorical variables and mean \u00b1 standard deviation or median with interquartile range for continuous variables. For skewed data distributions, we performed logarithmic transformation as appropriate. In the BKBC, multivariable linear regression models were used to assess associations of each plasma biomarker protein with ATI severity. In these models, the ATI severity score was used as the independent variable and each log2-transformed biomarker as the dependent variable. The adjusted model included the covariates age, race, sex, and eGFR. A prespeci /uniFB01 ed \u03b1 level of 7.58\u00d710 -6 set by Bonferroni correction (0.05/6592 proteins) was used to determine statistical signi /uniFB01 cance. In ARIC, we used Cox proportional hazards models to test associations between the ATI biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in the BKBC and the outcome of incident AKI. Models were adjusted for age, sex, selfreported race, SBP, smoking status, diabetes, hypertension UACR, and eGFR. In KPMP, we compared plasma levels of the ATI biomarkers in individuals with AKI and healthy controls using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). In the CHROME cohort, we explored associations between the ATI biomarkers and severe AKI within 7 days of ICU admission using logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and COVID-19 status. In KPMP, we used a Bonferroni-corrected signi /uniFB01 cance threshold of p &lt;3.21 \u00d7 10 -4 (0.05/156 proteins). In ARIC and CHROME, we adjusted this threshold to p &lt;4.1 \u00d7 10 -4 (0.05/122 proteins) and p &lt;3.79 \u00d7 10 -4 (0.05/132 proteins), respectively, re /uniFB02 ecting that only measurements of 122 (ARIC) and 132 (CHROME) of the 156 ATI biomarkerswereavailable. In other analyses, we considered a two-sided p -value &lt; 0.05 statistically signi /uniFB01 cant. Statistical analyses were performed using R Version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and STATA 18.0 (STATACorp, College Station, TX).\n\n## Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAccess to ARIC data follows NIH data sharing policies.

Acute tubular ' injury (ATI) is observed across various types of kidney diseases and may signi /uniFB01 cantly contribute to progression to kidney failure. Non-invasive biomarkers of ATI may allow for early detection and drug development. Using the SomaScanproteomics platform on 434 patients with biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmedkidney disease, we here identify plasma biomarkers associated with ATI severity. We employ regional transcriptomics and proteomics, single-cell RNA sequencing, and pathway analysis to explore biomarker protein and gene expression and enriched biological pathways. Additionally, we examine ATI biomarker associations with acute kidney injury (AKI) in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) ( n =44), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study ( n =4610), and the COVID-19 Host Response and Clinical Outcomes (CHROME) study ( n =268). Our /uniFB01 ndings indicate 156 plasma proteins signi /uniFB01 cantly linked to ATI with osteopontin, macrophage mannose receptor 1, and tenascin C showing the strongest associations. Pathway analysis highlight immune regulation and organelle stress responses in ATI pathogenesis.\n\nThe tubules play a crucial role in optimal functioning of the kidneys, and their impairment is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality from conditions such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) culminating in kidney failure 1,2 . Tubular lesions on histopathology have been described across virtually all forms of chronic and acute kidney diseases. The kidney tubules comprise &gt; 60% of the kidneys cellular mass and have ' amongthehighest density of mitochondria and metabolic workloads of any cell type in the body 3,4 . The high energy requirements of the tubules result from ATP-consuming reabsorption of over 99% of /uniFB01 ltered sodium, glucose, and amino acids from the glomerular ultra /uniFB01 ltrate . Several studies suggest that kidney function decline is 3 more closely correlated with tubulointerstitial damage than glomerular injury 5 -7 .\n\nAcute tubular injury (ATI) describes a combination of pathologic /uniFB01 ndings, including tubular dilatation and epithelial /uniFB02 attening, tubular cell sloughing, and loss of nuclei, that re /uniFB02 ect the morphologic responses of the tubules to a diverse range of insults 8 10 -. ATI stands as a hallmark in the diagnosis of AKI but also manifests in the context of CKD 10 . Episodes of ATI and subsequent maladaptive repair can lead to the development and progression of CKD 2,11 . Therapies focusing on preventing or treating the consequences of ATI are lacking, but could\n\nA full list of af /uniFB01 liations appears at the end of the paper. *A list of authors and their af /uniFB01 liations appears at the end of the paper. e-mail: ischmidt@bu.edu\n\nplay key roles in preventing morbidity and mortality from various kidney diseases.\n\nSeveral studies have illustrated how large-scale proteomics approaches can identify important protein markers to prognosticate the risk of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with kidney disease 12 -18 . Few studies have used this approach to determine noninvasive correlates of kidney histopathology, which could potentially lead to the identi /uniFB01 cation of new therapeutic targets 19 .\n\nIn the present study, we used an unbiased proteomics assay to measure 6592 plasma proteins in the Boston Kidney Biopsy Cohort (BKBC), a cohort study of individuals with biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmed kidney disease and adjudicated semi-quantitative assessment of ATI. We /uniFB01 rst assessed associations of each protein biomarker with ATI severity and determined enriched pathways that may have biological relevance for ATI pathogenesis. We then investigated the expression of biomarker proteins and corresponding biomarker-genes in regional proteomics and transcriptomics as well as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from human kidney. Lastly, we explored associations between our /uniFB01 ndings and the development of AKI in three additional cohort studies with available proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling: the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, andacohortofcritically ill patients from an intensive care unit (COVID19 Host Response and Clinical Outcomes (CHROME)) study.\n\n## Results\n\nAs outlined in Fig. 1, we analyzed data from (i) individuals with biopsycon rmed ATI, (ii) individuals biopsied for AKI and healthy controls, /uniFB01 (iii) individuals from the general population at risk for developing AKI, and (iv) critically ill individuals at risk of severe AKI.\n\n## Identi /uniFB01 cation and characterization of plasma biomarkers of ATI\n\nBaseline characteristics of the BKBC study cohort are shown in Table 1. The mean age was 54\u00b1 16 years and 48% were women. The mean eGFR was 51 \u00b1 33 ml/min/1.73m 2 and the median proteinuria (IQR) was 1.4 (0.3, 3.9) g/g creatinine. The most common primary clinicopathologic diagnoses were glomerulopathies (40%), diabetic nephropathy (16%), advanced chronic changes (15%), vascular disease (12%), and tubulointerstitial disease (11%). Figure 2a shows the breakdown of ATI severity by clinicopathologic diagnosis: 53% of BKBC participants had no ATI, 30% had mild ATI, 13% had moderate ATI, and 4% had severe ATI.\n\nAssociations between plasma biomarkers and ATI severity are shown in Fig. 2b and Supplemental Data 1. After multivariable adjustment and correction for multiple testing, 156 unique proteins (170 aptamers; some proteins are measured by 2 or more aptamers) were associated with ATI. Among those, higher levels of 126 proteins and lower levels of 30 proteins were independently associated with ATI severity. Higher levels of the following plasma biomarkers were associated with greater ATI severity (top 5 /uniFB01 ndings in the order of level of signi /uniFB01 cance): osteopontin ( SPP1 ), macrophage mannose receptor 1 ( MRC-1 ), tenascin C ( TNC ), netrin-4 ( NTN4 ), and marginal zone B- and B1-cell-speci /uniFB01 c protein ( MZB1 ). The top /uniFB01 ve plasma proteins negatively associated with ATI severity were plasma serine protease inhibitor ( SERPINA5 ), cholinesterase ( BCHE ), neuropeptide S ( NPS ), kallistatin ( SERPINA4) and alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein ( AHSG ). Additional proteins associated with ATI with biological relevance in kidney disease include kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1; HACVR1 ), WAP four-disul /uniFB01 de core domainprotein2(HE4; WFDC2 ), growth/differentiation factor-15 ( GDF15 ), serum amyloid A-1 protein ( SAA1 ), and serum amyloid A-2 protein ( SAA2 ).\n\nOf the 156 ATI biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in the BKBC, 78 were analyzed within the KPMP regional proteomics dataset. Comparison with glomerular expression revealed elevated protein expression of several ATI biomarkers in the tubulointerstitium (Fig. 3a). When comparing regional protein expression between individuals with AKI and healthy controls, we observed protein expression of eight ATI biomarkers. All except one (apolipoprotein A-1; APOA1 ) showed protein expression in direction concordant with greater ATI severity as observed in Study 1 (BKBC). We observed protein expression of our top ATI biomarker /uniFB01 ndings, osteopontin ( SPP1 ), macrophage mannose receptor 1 ( MRC-1 ), and tenascin C ( TNC ), in the tubulointersitium of kidneys with AKI (Fig. 3b). Utilizing regional transcriptomics data, 42 of the 156 ATI biomarkers were found to be expressed in kidney tubules, 29 of which showed higher tubular compared to glomerular expression. We observed the highest tubular expression for WFDC2, GDF15 , and SPP1 when compared to glomerular expression (Fig. 3c). Detailed expression of these three markers in different kidney cell types is shown in Supplemental Fig. 1. We observed prominent expression of WFDC2, GDF15 , and SPP1 in cell clusters of the thick ascending limb. SPP1 was also strongly expressed in distal convoluted tubule cell clusters, while GDF15 and WFDC2 expression was prominent in clusters of connecting tubule cells.\n\nOf the 156 unique proteins linked to ATI, several play roles in the regulation of the immune system and intracellular pathways. We identi /uniFB01 ed seven key pathways (all p &lt;0.05) with relevance for ATI pathogenesis. Of these, the top-ranked pathways were: ' Intracellular Organelle Lumen, ' ' Endoplasmic Reticulum Lumen, and ' ' Immune System ' (Fig. 3d). Additional pathways that had immunoregulatory capacities included ' Interactions Between Lymphoid and NonLymphoid Cells ' and Neutrophil Degranulation. ' ' Proteins involved in these pathways included several cytokines, interleukins, members of the TNF receptor superfamily, and regulators of the complement cascade (Supplemental Data 2).\n\n## Difference of ATI biomarker levels in individuals with AKI and healthy controls\n\nIn the KPMP study, we analyzed plasma concentrations of the 156 ATI biomarkers comparing individuals with AKI to healthy subjects. After Bonferroni correction, 93 unique ATI biomarkers had signi /uniFB01 cantly different plasma levels in AKI vs. healthy plasma (Fig. 4a). Of those, 77 ATI biomarkers were elevated and 16 were lower in individuals with AKI. The direction of these changes in all 93 biomarkers was consistent with the observations made in the BKBC (Fig. 4d). We observed the largest differences comparing AKI to healthy plasma levels for kidney injury molecule-1 ( HACVR1 ), WAP four-disul /uniFB01 de core domain protein 2 ( WFDC2 ), and growth/differentiation factor-15 ( GDF-15 ).\n\n## Associations of ATI biomarkers with incident AKI\n\nThe baseline characteristics of ARIC participants are shown in Supplemental Data 3. Over a median of 6.8 years, 1084 ARIC participants developedAKI. Of the 156 unique proteins identi /uniFB01 edasATIbiomarkers in Study 1 (BKBC), 122 proteins were measured in ARIC. Of those, 35 were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with higher risks and 10 with lower risks of incident AKI after multivariable adjustment (Fig. 4b and Supplemental Data 4). The direction of these associations was found to be consistent (Fig. 4d): the same 35 proteins associated with elevated risks of AKI in ARIC were also linked to more severe ATI in the BKBC. Among those were osteopontin ( SPP1 ), tenascin C ( TNC ), as well as WAP fourdisul /uniFB01 de core domain protein 2 (HE4; WFDC2 ) and growth/differentiation factor-15 ( GDF-15 ). Similarly, the 10 proteins associated with lower risks of AKI in ARIC corresponded to less severe ATI in the BKBC (Fig. 4d).\n\n## Associations of ATI biomarkers with severe AKI\n\nAmong the 268 critically ill patients enrolled into the CHROME study, 34 developed severe AKI on day 7 after ICU admission (Supplemental Data5). Of the previously identi /uniFB01 edATIbiomarkers,38uniquemarkers were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with severe AKI after adjustment for age, sex, and COVID-19 status. Of those, 36 were associated with higher risks and 2 with lower risks of severe AKI (Fig. 4c, d, and Supplemental\n\nFig. 1 | Outline of studies, study participants, and primary outcomes.

These included osteopontin ( SPP1 ), tenascin C ( TNC ), and mannose-binding lectin 2 ( LMAN2 ), among others (Fig. 4d).\n\nAdditionally, we expanded our investigation to examine associations betweenour /uniFB01 ndingsandthedevelopmentorprognosisofAKIinthree distinct cohorts with available proteomic data.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis study provides an assessment of the plasma proteome in a cohort of individuals with biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmed ATI followed by further study of the proteomic results in external cohorts. We identi /uniFB01 ed biomarkers of ATI severity, assessed their tubular expression, and conducted pathway enrichment analyses that highlighted immune regulation and organelle stress responses as central mechanisms in ATI pathogenesis.\n\nPrevious proteomics research has mainly centered on analyzing the plasma proteome to assess risks of adverse clinical outcomes in individuals with kidney disease 18,20 -22 . Fewer studies have utilized proteomics to interrogate associations between circulating proteins and kidney histopathologic changes including ATI 19,23,24 . Kidney tubular injury can lead to a signi /uniFB01 cant decrease in kidney function. While it is commonlylinked to the clinical syndrome of AKI, it may also in /uniFB02 uence the onset and progression of CKD 25 . Someof the individual proteins we investigated have previously been identi /uniFB01 ed to be associated with ATI. Among those, plasma KIM-1 stands as the most extensively studied marker 12,26 . In prior studies using both ELISA and proximity extension assay (Olink platform) 27 , we observed consistent associations of\n\nTable 1 | Baseline characteristics of BKBC participants\n\n| Baseline characteristics            | n = 434         |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Clinical characteristics            |                 |\n| Age, years                          | 54.4 \u00b1 16.2     |\n| Female                              | 206 (47.5)      |\n| Race                                |                 |\n| White                               | 286 (66.2)      |\n| Black                               | 87 (20.1)       |\n| Other                               | 59 (13.7)       |\n| eGFR, ml/min/1.73m 2                | 50.8 \u00b1 33.2     |\n| Proteinuria, g/g creatinine         | 1.4 [0.3 - 3.9] |\n| Reason for biopsy *                 |                 |\n| Proteinuria                         | 231 (53.2)      |\n| Hematuria                           | 107 (24.7)      |\n| Nephrotic syndrome                  | 50 (11.5)       |\n| Nephritic syndrome                  | 8 (1.8)         |\n| Abnormal eGFR/Other                 | 300 (69.1)      |\n| Primary clinicopathologic diagnosis |                 |\n| Proliferative glomerulonephritis    | 111 (25.6)      |\n| Diabetic nephropathy                | 68 (15.7)       |\n| Non-proliferative glomerulopathy    | 62 (14.3)       |\n| Advanced chronic changes            | 63 (14.5)       |\n| Vascular disease                    | 52 (12.0)       |\n| Tubulointerstitial disease          | 48 (11.1)       |\n| Other                               | 30 (6.9)        |\n| Co-morbid conditions                |                 |\n| Hypertension                        | 256 (59.0)      |\n| Diabetes mellitus                   | 126 (29.0)      |\n| Systemic vasculitis                 | 11 (2.5)        |\n| Systemic Lupus Erythematosus        | 8 (1.8)         |\n| Hepatitis B                         | 4 (0.9)         |\n| Hepatitis C                         | 11 (2.5)        |\n| Malignancy                          | 64 (14.7)       |\n| HIV                                 | 4 (0.9)         |\n| Solid organ transplant (non-renal)  | 14 (3.2)        |\n| Medications                         |                 |\n| ACEi                                | 131 (30.2)      |\n| ARB                                 | 70 (16.1)       |\n| MRA                                 | 11 (2.5)        |\n| Calcium channel blockers            | 120 (27.6)      |\n| Beta-blockers                       | 156 (35.9)      |\n| Immunosuppression                   | 48 (11.1)       |\n| Corticosteroids                     | 68 (15.7)       |\n\nData presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, median [IQR] and count with frequencies (%) for binary and categorical variables.

Many other /uniFB01 ndings from the present study unveil new insights that may pave the foundation for future investigation.\n\nThe biomarker most strongly associated with more severe ATI was osteopontin (OPN; SPP1 ). OPN is a 44 kD glycoprotein predominantly secreted in bone and epithelial tissues. In the kidney, expression increases during injury 29,30 . Recent mechanistic studies have identi /uniFB01 ed circulating OPN derived from kidney tubule cells as a key mediator of AKI-induced acute lung injury 31 . Another study showed that plasma OPN levels in individuals recovering from AKI\n\nwere signi /uniFB01 cantly higher when compared to individuals with irreversible loss of kidney function after AKI 32 . In the setting of CKD, higher serum OPN levels were associated with worse kidney function and greater risk of kidney failure and death 33 . Our results provide further evidence for a strong association of OPN with tubular injury and suggest its potential as a speci /uniFB01 c tool to assess for the degree of ATI. Similarly, we found a consistent relationship between higher tenascin C (TNC; TNC ) levels, more severe ATI, and greater risk of AKI across cohorts. TNC, an extracellular matrix protein, is upregulated in the tubulointerstitium of CKD patients and has been shown to be involved in the transition from AKI to CKD by impairing tubular integrity through \u03b1 \u03b2 v 6 integrin signaling 34 .\n\nWe also observed strong associations between ATI severity and human epididymis protein-4 (HE4; WFDC2 ) and growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15; GDF-15 ). Both markers had higher levels in AKI, were associated with incident AKI, and were also among the top markers expressed in kidney tubules. HE4 is a serine protease inhibitor that has recently been shown to promote kidney /uniFB01 brosis by inhibiting the degradation of type I collagen 35 . Studies also found a positive correlation between higher HE4 levels and more severe kidney /uniFB01 brosis 36,37 . A prior investigation in diabetic kidney disease demonstrated that higher HE4 levels associated with increased risks of future kidney function decline 38 . Our study adds that HE4 may play an important role in the development of ATI. Additionally, the upregulation of this marker in both CKD (as shown in prior studies) and AKI underscores the interconnectedness between the two conditions and may provide additional evidence for the importance of kidney tubular injury in CKD progression 12,13,26,39 .\n\nGDF-15 is a member of the TGF\u03b2 superfamily and has recently been described as a marker of oxidative stress in mitochondrial diseases 40,41 . In the kidney, GDF-15 exhibits a range of functions that are variably antagonistic or complementary, contingent upon the cellular state and surrounding microenvironment 42 45 -. While some studies have found a potentially nephroprotective role for GDF-15 through the regulation of tubular Klotho expression 43 and downregulation of in /uniFB02 ammatory activities 45 48 -, elevated levels of circulating and urinary GDF-15 have been linked to increased risks of incident CKD, CKD progression, and death in individuals with kidney disease 44,45 , as well as higher risk of cardio-renal outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes 49 . After ischemia-reperfusion injury, GDF-15-de /uniFB01 cient mice had more severe ATI whereas recombinant GDF-15 attenuated kidney injury 50 . It is possible that in patients with kidney disease, GDF-15 levels may not have a pathogenic role but rather re /uniFB02 ect a compensatory response to acute or chronic injury that is present in the setting of oxidative stress. To our knowledge, this is the /uniFB01 rst study to investigate the association between biopsy-con /uniFB01 rmed ATI and GDF-15 in a large cohort of individuals with a diverse spectrum of kidney diseases. The observed association between higher GDF-15-levels and more severe ATI may yield further con rmation for the central /uniFB01 role of mitochondrial dysfunction in acute and chronic kidney disease where GDF-15 may act as an important mediator of mitochondrial stress responses 41 .\n\nAnother ATI marker associated with AKI across all cohort studies was LMAN2, which has been previously shown by Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses to be causally associated with kidney function. LMAN2, a protein also known as vesicular integral-membrane protein (VIP36), is implicated in transport processes and metabolic activities occurring on the apical surface of kidney epithelial cells 51 . Prior studies have demonstrated that LMAN2 correlates with albuminuria and is associated with kidney function decline 51,52 . A number of biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in this study, especially those with previously demonstrated signi /uniFB01 cant MR /uniFB01 ndings, merit additional evaluation for their therapeutic potential in a range of kidney diseases.\n\nWe found lower levels of seven plasma proteins to be associated with more severe ATI that were also signi /uniFB01 cantly lower in individuals\n\nFig. 2 | Acute tubular injury (ATI) scores and identi /uniFB01 cation of ATI biomarkers. a Distribution of semiquantitative severity scores for ATI by clinicopathologic diagnostic category in the Boston Kidney Biopsy Cohort (BKBC), Study 1. b Circulating plasma proteins associated with ATI severity in native kidney biopsy specimens.

Amongthosewasplasmakallikrein ( KLKB1 ), a serine protease inhibitor implicated in coagulation and blood pressure regulation 53 . Concordant with our observations, another investigation in type 1 diabetes revealed that plasma kallikrein activity decreased in more advanced stages of diabetic nephropathy, reaching its lowest levels in individuals undergoing dialysis 54 . Additionally, a recent genome-wide association study in the German CKD Study on OPN revealed a signi /uniFB01 cant association at a locus within KLKB1 , suggesting a potential link between OPN and the kallikrein-kinin system 55 . We also found that levels of complement C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 3 (C1QTNF3; C1QTNF3 ), a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family, were lower in individuals with AKI. This is congruent with a smaller investigation focused on diabetic patients, which reported lower serum levels of C1QTNF3 in those with type 2 diabetes when compared to healthy controls 56 . These /uniFB01 ndings are further supported by in vitro experiments demonstrating that C1QTNF3 mitigates TGF\u03b2 1-mediated kidney /uniFB01 brosis 57 and ameliorates lipid accumulation and necroin/uniFB02 ammation induced by high glucose concentrations in renal tubular cells 58 .\n\nWhile the functional signi /uniFB01 cance and potential prognostic value of these proteins remain to be fully investigated, many of them are involved in common biological pathways relevant to tubular injury such as regulation of immune and cellular stress responses. The leading pathways in our study related to cellular organelle stress including mitochondrial or endoplasmic reticulum damage. These pathways are critical in AKI onset and can also drive in /uniFB02 ammation and /uniFB01 brosis, key factors in the transition from AKI to CKD when stress is sustained 59 . In fact, several markers found in this study are markers involved in the pathogenesis of both AKI and CKD. Traditionally, ATI parameters have not been systematically assessed in biopsies obtained for CKD evaluation. It is possible, however, that the extent of ATI could serve as a valuable prognostic indicator for assessing the likelihood of transitioning from acute to chronic kidney injury, underscoring the potential bene /uniFB01 t of incorporating routine ATI assessment in CKD biopsies to enhance prognostic accuracy.\n\nSigni /uniFB01 cant strengths of our study include the large number of protein biomarkers included in the analyses. Detailed adjudicated histopathologic scores by two kidney pathologists allowed us to test associations between markers and the degree of ATI.

Our study has several limitations that warrant consideration as well. Given the intrinsic limitations of cross-sectional studies, which prevent the establishment of causality, additional experimental and clinical studies are needed to establish the causal role of the ATI biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in this study. While our study cohort underwent comprehensive phenotypic characterization, enabling extensive multivariable adjustment, we cannot exclude the potential in /uniFB02 uence of unmeasured confounding variables on our results. Our study delineates several proteins that warrant further investigation in animal models to elucidate their tissue-speci /uniFB01 c function within the kidney.\n\nIn conclusion, our proteomics study identi /uniFB01 ed over 150 proteins in the plasma of individuals with histologically con rmed tubular /uniFB01 injury, with subsequent interrogation of /uniFB01 ndings in separate cohort studies with plasma proteomics, regional proteomics, and single-cell transcriptomics.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Ethical compliance\n\nWehavecompliedwithallethical regulations related to this study. All studies included received approval from their respective institutional review boards (IRB) at each participating center which included the Mass General Brigham IRB (BKBC study), the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill IRB (ARIC Study), the Johns Hopkins University IRB (ARIC Study), the University of Minnesota IRB (ARIC Study), the University of Mississippi Medical Center IRB (ARIC Study), and the University of Washington IRB (KPMP and CHROME studies). Informed consent was obtained from participants of the BKBC, ARIC, and KPMP studies. In the CHROME study, participants were enrolled under an IRB-approved waiver of informed consent. All studies were conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n## Study populations\n\nThe BKBC is a prospective, observational cohort study of patients who underwent native kidney biopsy at three tertiary care hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts, including Brigham and Womens Hospital, ' Massachusetts General Hospital, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical\n\nFig. 3 | Expression of acute tubular injury (ATI) biomarkers in regional proteomics and transcriptomics data and pathway analysis. a ATI biomarkers with elevated protein expression comparing tubulointerstitial to glomerular levels in KPMPregionalproteomicsdata(AKI, CKD,HRT combined). b Protein expression of ATI biomarkers in the tubulointerstitium of individuals with AKI compared to healthy controls using Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test and Benjamini -Hochberg FDR to account for multiple comparisons.

The study includes adults \u2265 18 years of age who underwent a clinically indicated kidney biopsy between September 2006 and October 2018. Exclusion criteria were the inability to provide written consent, severe anemia, pregnancy, and enrollment in competing studies. Details of the study design have been previously described 60 . Patients provided blood samples on the day of kidney biopsy. For this study, we evaluated 434 participants with available plasma samples. The KPMP is a multicenter prospective cohort study of people with CKD or AKI who undergo a protocol kidney biopsy at study entry as part of the KPMP consortium (https://KPMP.org) 61 . For plasma proteomics analyses, we evaluated protein measurements of 44 participants (26 with AKI and 18 who provided healthy reference tissue). The ARIC study is a prospective cohort study of individuals recruited from four US communities 62 . Participants were enrolled between 1987 and 1989, with subsequent visits in 1990 -1992 (visit 2), 1993 -1995 (visit 3), 1996 1998 -(visit 4), 2011 -2013 (visit 5), 2016 2017 -(visit 6), and 2018 2019 (visit 7), visit -8 (2020), visit 9 (2021 -2022), and visit 10 (2023). In this study, we included 4,610 participants from visit 5 who had available plasma proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling and non-missing covariates at baseline. The CHROME study is a prospective cohort study of critically ill patients admitted to three hospitals af /uniFB01 liated with the University of Washington in Seattle, WA between March 2020 and May 2021. Details of the study design have been previously described 63 . In brief, patients were eligible if admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU) with signs or symptoms of acute respiratory illness. Exclusion criteria included being under 18 years of age, incarcerated, pregnant, or undergoing chronic maintenance hemodialysis. In this study, we included 268 individuals with available SOMAScan plasma proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling. All studies included in this manuscript received approval from their respective institutional review boards at each participating center.\n\n## Sample collection and proteomics assays\n\nProteomic pro /uniFB01 ling was performed on blood samples from the baseline visit of the BKBC, KPMP, and CHROME cohort, as well as visit 5 of the ARIC study. After collection, blood samples were aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0C. The SOMAscan assay was utilized for proteomic measurements 64 . This assay employs SOMAmers (selective singlestranded deoxyoligonucleotides) for protein binding and quanti /uniFB01 es proteins based on /uniFB02 uorescence intensity, indicative of relative protein concentrations. The ARIC and CHROME plasma samples were analyzed using the SOMAscan 5k platform (approximately 5000 proteins), while the BKBC and KPMP samples were assessed using the SOMAscan 7k platform (approximately 7000 proteins). In the BKBC, 6592 aptamers passed quality control metrics and were included in subsequent analyses; the mean coef /uniFB01 cient of variation (CV) on 8 blind duplicate pairs was 4.7%. In ARIC, KPMP, and the CHROME cohort, we evaluated only those proteins that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with ATI in the BKBC (156 unique proteins). For ARIC visit 5, the mean Bland Altman coef /uniFB01 cient of variation was 6.6% from 26 samples in blind triplicate. In KPMP, the mean CVs on 2 sets of 4 blind duplicates was 4.9%. For all studies, protein aptamers were log2-transformed and winsorized at mean\u00b15\u00d7SD and adaptive normalization was performed by maximum likelihood as previously described 64 .\n\n## Histopathologic outcome\n\nIn the BKBC, kidney biopsy specimens were adjudicated under light microscopy by two experienced kidney pathologists who provided semiquantitative scores of ATI scored from 0 to 3 re /uniFB02 ecting none, mild, moderate, and severe lesion severity. Methods to evaluate and score histopathologic lesion severity were previously described in detail 60 . The weighted kappa statistic (95% CI) from 26 randomly selected biopsies for repeat review months after the initial scoring for ATI was 0.67 (0.45 -0.89) 60 . All participants ' charts were reviewed alongside histopathologic evaluations to provide the /uniFB01 nal primary clinicopathologic diagnosis.\n\n## Outcome of acute kidney injury\n\nIn KPMP, patients eligible for percutaneous kidney biopsy for AKI must have elevated serum creatinine that is either sustained or accompanied by evidence of parenchymal injury. Detailed inclusion criteria for AKI biopsies were previously described in detail 61 . In ARIC, individuals included in this study were free of AKI at baseline and followed prospectively for incident AKI. Incident cases of AKI were identi /uniFB01 ed by International Classi /uniFB01 cation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modi /uniFB01 cation (ICD-9-CM) codes 584.5 to 584.9 and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modi cation (ICD-10-CM) codes N17.0 to N17.9 or a 50% increase from /uniFB01 outpatient serum creatinine during hospitalization. ICD codes were retrieved from hospital discharge billing and death certi /uniFB01 cates 65 . In the CHROME Cohort, the primary outcome was severe AKI within 7 days, de ned by either initiation of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) or a /uniFB01 doubling of serum creatinine from ICU admission 63 . In the ARIC and CHROME studies, blood samples were collected prior to the diagnosis of AKI or severe AKI, respectively.\n\n## Covariates\n\nIn the BKBC, detailed patient information was collected at the biopsy visit, including demographics, medical history, medication lists, and pertinent laboratory data and stored using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Partners Health Care. We obtained serum creatinine (SCr) from the electronic medical record (EMR) on the day of biopsy. In participants for whom this was unavailable, we measured SCr in available blood samples collected on the day of the biopsy. We obtained spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) from the date of kidney biopsy to 3monthsbeforebiopsyfromtheEMR.Ifbothwereavailable,theUACR wasused.Ifaparticipant did not have any of thesevalues, we measured urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio from urine collected on the day of the kidney biopsy. SCr and urine creatinine were measured using a Jaffebased method and urine albumin was measured by an immunoturbidometric method. The creatinine-based Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration 2021 equation was used to calculate the eGFR 66 . In ARIC, covariates included age, sex, self-reported race, systolic blood pressure (SBP), UACR, smoking status, diabetes (fasting glucose of \u2265 126 mg/dL or non-fasting glucose level of \u2265 200mg/dL, self-reported history of diabetes diagnosed by a physician, or use of medications for diabetes), hypertension (SBP \u2265 140 mm Hg and DBP \u2265 90mm Hg, or use of medication for high BP), and eGFR (calculated using the CKD-EPI 2021 equation, which takes both serum creatinine and cystatin C into account) 66 . Serum creatinine was measured using a Roche enzymatic method (visit 5) and serum cystatin C was measured using the Roche Cobas 6000 chemistry analyzer. The UACR was calculated using urine albumin and creatinine (measured using an immunoturbidometric method on the ProSpec nephelometric analyzer and the Roche enzymatic method, respectively). In CHROME, covariates including age, sex, and COVID-19 status were extracted from the EMR.\n\n## Regional proteomics\n\nWeinvestigated the expression of ATI biomarker proteins in regional tissue proteomics from KPMP kidney biopsy samples (https://atlas. kpmp.org/explorer/regionalpro; access date: April 20, 2024). Detailed protocols and dataset information are available at https:// www.kpmp.org/help-docs/technologies. In brief, kidney tissue was laser-microdissected to isolate glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartments. Following protein extraction from targeted tissue sections, proteins were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) for comprehensive identi /uniFB01 cation and quanti /uniFB01 cation. The study included tissue samples from 31 individuals (12 with AKI, 14 with CKD, and 5 healthy controls). We analyzed and compared the expression pro /uniFB01 les of ATI biomarkers between the tubulointerstitial and glomerular\n\ncompartments across all participants, and separately, evaluated differences in tubulointerstitial protein expression between healthy controls and those with AKI.\n\n## Kidney gene expression analysis\n\nTo map biomarker proteins to gene expression data, we investigated the expression of ATI biomarker-corresponding genes using regional transcriptomics and scRNA-seq data from KPMP (https://atlas.kpmp. org/explorer; access date: August 1, 2023). Tissue samples used for regional transcriptomics were drawn from living donor biopsy participants and used to compare expression (Fold Change) of our ATI biomarker genes of interest in the tubulointerstitium ( n =36; 9 healthy reference, 22 CKD, 5 AKI). Tissue samples analyzed using scRNA-seq were drawn from 47 participants (12 with AKI, 15 with CKD, and 20 healthy controls) and used to test for differential gene expression in kidney cell types. Details on these datasets have been described previously 67,68 .\n\n## Pathway analysis\n\nTo obtain basic functional information on biomarker proteins that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with ATI severity and to investigate potentially relevant biological pathways, we applied Pathway Enrichment Analysis using gene sets obtained from publicly available databases including Gene Ontology, KEGG, and Reactome 69,70 . We ranked proteins based on their strength of association with ATI. We then calculated normalized enrichment scores to identify pathways with signi /uniFB01 cant overrepresentation of ATI biomarkers. The Benjamini -Hochbergapproachwas employed to account for multiple testings and used to rank pathways based on the obtained p -value. Analyses were performed using the R package fgsea.\n\n## Statistical analysis\n\nWe summarized descriptive statistics as count with percentages for categorical variables and mean \u00b1 standard deviation or median with interquartile range for continuous variables. For skewed data distributions, we performed logarithmic transformation as appropriate. In the BKBC, multivariable linear regression models were used to assess associations of each plasma biomarker protein with ATI severity. In these models, the ATI severity score was used as the independent variable and each log2-transformed biomarker as the dependent variable. The adjusted model included the covariates age, race, sex, and eGFR. A prespeci /uniFB01 ed \u03b1 level of 7.58\u00d710 -6 set by Bonferroni correction (0.05/6592 proteins) was used to determine statistical signi /uniFB01 cance. In ARIC, we used Cox proportional hazards models to test associations between the ATI biomarkers identi /uniFB01 ed in the BKBC and the outcome of incident AKI. Models were adjusted for age, sex, selfreported race, SBP, smoking status, diabetes, hypertension UACR, and eGFR. In KPMP, we compared plasma levels of the ATI biomarkers in individuals with AKI and healthy controls using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). In the CHROME cohort, we explored associations between the ATI biomarkers and severe AKI within 7 days of ICU admission using logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and COVID-19 status. In KPMP, we used a Bonferroni-corrected signi /uniFB01 cance threshold of p &lt;3.21 \u00d7 10 -4 (0.05/156 proteins). In ARIC and CHROME, we adjusted this threshold to p &lt;4.1 \u00d7 10 -4 (0.05/122 proteins) and p &lt;3.79 \u00d7 10 -4 (0.05/132 proteins), respectively, re /uniFB02 ecting that only measurements of 122 (ARIC) and 132 (CHROME) of the 156 ATI biomarkerswereavailable. In other analyses, we considered a two-sided p -value &lt; 0.05 statistically signi /uniFB01 cant. Statistical analyses were performed using R Version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and STATA 18.0 (STATACorp, College Station, TX).\n\n## Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAccess to ARIC data follows NIH data sharing policies.

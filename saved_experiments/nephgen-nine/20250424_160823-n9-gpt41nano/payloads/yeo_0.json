All analyses were adjusted for clinical and demographic covariates, including for baseline eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) in longitudinal analyses.\n\nResults At visit 5 of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, the mean age of participants was 76 years (SD 6); 56% were women, mean eGFR was 62 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 20), and median UACR level was 13 mg/g (interquartile range, 25). In cross-sectional analysis, 675 serum and 542 urine metabolites were associated with eGFR (Bonferroni-corrected P , 4.0E-5 for serum analyses and P , 3.6E-5 for urine analyses), including 248 metabolites shared across bio /uniFB02 uids. Fewer metabolites (75 serum and 91 urine metabolites, including seven metabolites shared across bio /uniFB02 uids) were cross-sectionally associated with albuminuria. Guanidinosuccinate; N2,N2-dimethylguanosine; hydroxy-N6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine; X-13844; and X-25422 were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with both eGFR and albuminuria. Over a mean follow-up of 6.6 years, serum mannose (hazard ratio [HR], 2.3 [1.6 -3.2], P 5 2.7E-5) and urine X-12117 (HR, 1.7 [1.3 -2.2], P 5 1.9E-5) were risk factors of UACR doubling, whereas urine sebacate (HR, 0.86 [0.80 -0.92], P 5 1.9E-5) was inversely associated. Compared with clinical characteristics alone, including the top /uniFB01 ve endogenous metabolites in serum and urine associated with longitudinal outcomes improved the outcome prediction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for eGFR decline: clinical model 5 0.79, clinical 1 metabolites model 5 0.87, P 5 8.1E-6; for UACR doubling: clinical model 5 0.66, clinical 1 metabolites model 5 0.73, P 5 2.9E-5).\n\nConclusions Metabolomic pro /uniFB01 ling in different bio /uniFB02 uids provided distinct and potentially complementary insights into the biology and prognosis of kidney diseases.\n\nJASN 35: 1252 -1265, 2024. doi: https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.0000000000000403\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe kidney is an organ that interfaces between blood and urine, and its function is quanti /uniFB01 ed by the accumulation and /uniFB02 ow of small molecules or metabolites across bio /uniFB02 uids. eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) are two metrics commonly used to quantify kidney function and injury, with both metrics incorporating creatinine, a small molecule that is both /uniFB01 ltered and secreted by the kidney. Low eGFR and high UACR levels are associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes, such as kidney failure and mortality. 1 4 -\n\nMetabolomics refers to the large-scale identi /uniFB01 cation and quanti /uniFB01 cation of metabolites in biological systems. This tool, to date primarily implemented in blood, has allowed for the discovery of circulating biomarkers associated with clinical outcomes, such as CKD. 5 8 -Given the kidney s role in ' /uniFB01 ltration, both serum and urine metabolomic investigations may inform the study of kidney diseases.\n\nDue to the number of contributing authors, the affiliations are listed at the end of this article.\n\nCorrespondence: Dr. Morgan E. Grams or Dr. Pascal Schlosser, email: Morgan.Grams@nyulangone.org or pascal.schlosser@uniklinik-freiburg.de\n\nReceived: February 16, 2024 Accepted: May 29, 2024 Published Online Ahead of Print: June 6, 2024\n\nIn addition to creatinine, other serum or urine-based metabolites may add information regarding kidney function, injury, or prognosis.\n\nA few previous kidney metabolomic studies have considered metabolites pro /uniFB01 led within serum and urine, but sample size or the metabolomic platform was limited or data restricted to blood levels. 9 14 -In this study, we aimed to identify non-drug serum and urine metabolites that were crosssectionally associated with eGFR or UACR, as well as metabolites that were longitudinally associated with a 40% decline in eGFR or UACR doubling in a large general population cohort. We assessed these associations using the same high-throughput metabolomics platform for 1255 and 1398 metabolites in serum and urine, respectively. We also aimed to assess whether including serum, urine, or both sets of metabolites with clinical variables can improve the performance of models predicting kidney function decline.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Study Population\n\nThe Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study is an ongoing study that began in 1987 that aims to investigate causes and clinical consequences of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases with respect to demographic characteristics. 15 The study recruited 15,792 participants aged between 45 and 64 years at enrollment (visit 1) from four communities (Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; Minneapolis suburbs, MN; and Washington County, MD).\n\nOur study population was drawn from the 6538 ARIC participants who attended visit 5 (2011 -2013). To be included in the current analyses, we required that participants had non-missing eGFRcr,cys ( n 5 101 excluded), were in either the White or Black race category ( n 5 18 excluded), had no prevalent kidney failure ( n 5 36 excluded), and had both serum and urine metabolite data available with at least 50% detectable endogenous metabolites (Supplemental Figure 1). This selection resulted in a study sample of 1612 participants used in cross-sectional analyses.\n\nFor the longitudinal analyses with a 40% decline in eGFR or UACR doubling, we required that participants had at least one follow-up visit at visit 6 (2016 -2017) or 7 (2018 -2019) with non-missing eGFR or UACR data. This resulted in 942 individuals in our study population for the decline in eGFR analysis and 894 individuals for the doubling in UACR analyses. ARIC conducted active surveillance and is linked to mortality and the United States Renal Data System registries.\n\nTo assess whether including serum, urine, or both sets of metabolites improved prediction of eGFR decline or UACR doubling beyond clinical variables, individuals common to both longitudinal study samples were included ( n 5 879).\n\nReplication of longitudinal analyses were conducted in the ongoing prospective German Chronic Kidney Disease (GCKD) study, which began in 2010 and enrolled 5217 adult individuals with CKD. 16 Inclusion criteria encompassed patients regularly visited by nephrologists, with an eGFR between 30 and 60 ml min 2 1 per 1.73 m 2 or an eGFR . 60 ml min 2 1 per 1.73 m 2 along with UACR . 300 mg per gram (or urinary protein-creatinine ratio . 500 mg per gram). The GCKD study was registered in the national clinical studies registry (DRKS 00003971) and received approval from the local ethics committees at participating institutions (universities or medical faculties of Aachen, Berlin, Erlangen, Freiburg, Hannover, Heidelberg, Jena, Munchen, and Wurzburg). \u0308 \u0308 All participants provided written informed consent.\n\n## Metabolomic Profiling and Preprocessing\n\nSerum and urine samples stored at 2 80\u00b0C were sent to Metabolon, Inc. (Durham, NC) for untargeted metabolite pro /uniFB01 ling by liquid chromatography -mass spectroscopy (serum pro /uniFB01 led in 2019, urine pro /uniFB01 led in 2022). A total of 1464 serum metabolites (including 320 unnamed and 302 drug metabolites) and 1581 urine metabolites (including 467 unnamed and 382 drug metabolites) were identi /uniFB01 ed and quanti /uniFB01 ed. Metabolites were categorized into ten superpathways by Metabolon, namely amino acid, carbohydrate, cofactors and vitamins, energy, lipid, nucleotide, partially characterized molecules, peptide, unknown, and xenobiotics. Drug metabolites were excluded from our analyses (serum: 302 metabolites, urine: 382 metabolites). The preprocessing steps for serum and urine data were conducted in parallel.\n\nFirst, for both serum and urine data, each metabolite was batch normalized to account for minor instrument variations between batches per manufacturer protocol (Metabolon, Inc.). Missing values were imputed with the minimum observed value for endogenous and unnamed metabolites present in more than 20% of samples.\n\nFor urine data only, we accounted for the varying dilutions between samples using probability quotient (PQ) normalization. 17 In the context of urine metabolomics, PQ normalization operates by /uniFB01 nding a most probable dilution factor estimated from a low-missingness subset of metabolites to normalize each sample. We estimated our PQ factors for normalization on the basis of all 372 endogenous metabolites with , 1% missing sample measurements. The PQ factors were computed with the nonimputed data of these metabolites and then used to normalize the samples for the imputed urine data. In Supplemental Figure 2, we provide a plot of the PQ factors against urinary creatinine, the reference that is used clinically. 18,19\n\nFor both serum and urine data, we then rescaled each metabolite to have a median of 1 and then log2 transformed the metabolites to reduce skewness. Metabolites with variance # 0.01 were removed, and endogenous and unnamed metabolites were winsorized at 5 SDs. Finally, we excluded any metabolites with . 80% missing sample measurements.\n\nThe /uniFB01 nal dataset consisted of 1255 serum metabolites and 1398 urine metabolites, with 721 metabolites detected in both bio /uniFB02 uids.\n\nGCKDmetabolomics were quanti /uniFB01 ed from stored EDTA plasma and spot urine. Preprocessing was conducted analogously, except for winsorization, which was not performed. 20 The /uniFB01 nal dataset for the selected plasma and urine metabolites consisted of 4744 individuals with complete data.\n\n## Covariates\n\nStudy center included four categories as mentioned earlier: Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; Minneapolis suburbs, MN;andWashington County, MD. Diabetes was de /uniFB01 ned as having a blood glucose level of $ 140 mg/dl after a fasting\n\nperiod of $ 8 hours or a nonfasting blood glucose level of $ 200 mg/dl, a self-reported clinical diagnosis of diabetes, or taking medications for diabetes or high blood glucose. Systolic BP was determined using the average of the second and third sitting BP measurements of three total measurements that were taken 5 minutes apart with no change in posture. Prevalent coronary heart disease was de /uniFB01 ned as having prevalent myocardial infarction from adjudicated electrocardiogram data in visit 5, diagnosed myocardial infarction, or a history of coronary bypass or angioplasty of a coronary artery/arteries. Age, sex, race, and smoking status (current smoker, former smoker, never smoked, or unknown) were self-reported. The use of hypertension medications was ascertained by inspection of medications taken in the previous 2 weeks. The race-free 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation 21 was used to calculate the eGFR for each visit using both serum creatinine and cystatin C. Creatinine was measured using the Roche enzymatic method, whereas cystatin C was measured by immunoturbidimetry. Urine albumin (used to calculate urine albumin-creatinine ratios [UACR], i.e ., albuminuria) at each visit was quanti /uniFB01 ed by immunoturbidimetry from random urine samples. Total cholesterol, weight, and height (the latter two used to de /uniFB01 ne body mass index) were measured during visit 5. GCKD used the 2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation based on serum creatinine. 22\n\n## Statistical Analysis\n\nBaseline characteristics of the study population were summarized using means and SDs or medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for skewed distributions and for continuous variables, respectively. Categorical variables were summarized with counts and proportions. To characterize the serum and urine metabolome on a descriptive level before integrating kidney function, metabolites were sorted by their superpathways and the Spearman correlations between all pairs of metabolites were calculated. The median correlations by superpathway were then calculated excluding paired serum -serum and urine -urine metabolites that have a correlation of 1. Summary statistics of the correlations by superpathways for paired serum -urine metabolites were separately reported.\n\nIn the cross-sectional analyses to investigate associations between metabolites within each bio /uniFB02 uid and eGFR or log2(UACR), sequentially adjusted multiple linear regression models were implemented: model 1 adjusted for demographics only, that is, age, sex, race, and study center; model 2 adjusted additionally for body mass index, systolic BP, diabetes, prevalent coronary heart disease, use of hypertension medications, smoking status, and total cholesterol; model 3 adjusted additionally for log2(UACR) when assessing associations with eGFR or eGFR when assessing associations with log2(UACR).\n\nTo assess whether speci /uniFB01 c superpathways were overrepresented among the metabolites that were associated with eGFR or UACR, a permutation test was performed by repeating the regression analyses over all metabolites for a total of 1000 times. 23 Metabolite levels were permuted en bloc to retain the same correlation structure. In other words, the data structure was retained, but eGFR (or UACR)\n\nwas permuted for a total of 1000 permutations. In each permutation, all metabolite regressions were performed. The number of signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites from the original analysis was used to identify the top associations from each permutation. A superpathway was determined to be over-represented if the original number of signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites in the superpathway was greater than the number of signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites in the same superpathway in more than 95% of the permutations ( P , 0.05).\n\nIn the longitudinal analyses to investigate associations between metabolites within each bio /uniFB02 uid and 40% eGFR decline or UACR doubling from visit 5 by visit 7 (mean follow-up time of 6.6 years), three sequentially adjusted logistic regression models were considered as before. Of note, model 3 adjusted for both baseline eGFR and log2(UACR) in both analyses.\n\nMultiple tests were accounted for using a Bonferronicorrected threshold to assess for statistical signi /uniFB01 cance. Signi /uniFB01 cant serum metabolites were de /uniFB01 ned to have P , 0.05/ 1255 5 4.0E-5, whereas signi /uniFB01 cant urine metabolites were de /uniFB01 ned to have P , 0.05/1397 5 3.6E-5.\n\nMetabolites found to be signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with kidney function or kidney function decline were reassessed with model 3 in individuals strati /uniFB01 ed by diabetes status, excluding the diabetes adjustment.\n\nTo investigate whether including both urine and serum metabolites in a logistic model for a 40% decline in eGFR or UACR doubling improved discrimination as compared with clinical covariates, we /uniFB01 rst de /uniFB01 ned a model using clinical covariates described in model 3 of the longitudinal analyses, assessing performance using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Then, we evaluated models with clinical covariates 1 the top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites only, clinical covariates 1 the top /uniFB01 ve urine metabolites only, and clinical covariates 1 the top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites and top /uniFB01 veurine metabolites. The top metabolites were selected from endogenous metabolites with the lowest P values from model 3 of the longitudinal analyses. Model improvement was assessed using the difference in AUC (DeLong test). 24 GCKDanalyses did not include race and center as covariates.\n\n## Results\n\n## Baseline Characteristics of Study Populations\n\nThe study population for the cross-sectional analyses included 1612 participants with a mean age of 76 years (SD 6); 56% were women, 49% were Black, mean eGFR was 62 ml/ min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 20), and median UACR was 13 mg/g (IQR, 25) (Table 1).\n\nFor longitudinal analyses with eGFR decline as the outcome, the study population with 942 participants had a mean age of 75 years (SD 5); 59% were female, 54% were Black, the mean eGFR was 65 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 20), and the median UACR was 10 mg/g (IQR, 18). The mean time between visits was 3.4 years, and 10% ( n 5 97) people developed a 40% decline in eGFR, whereas 33% ( n 5 294) people developed doubling of UACR.\n\n## Metabolite-Metabolite Correlations\n\nIntermetabolite correlation varied across superpathways (Figure 1A).

A higher proportion of serum metabolites were inversely associated with eGFR compared with urine metabolites (71% for serum versus 56% for urine), representing accumulation of many metabolites in lower eGFR.\n\nTop metabolites that were higher with lower eGFR included creatinine ( b 52 0.014, P , 1.0E-323), hydroxyasparagine ( b 52 0.020, P , 1.0E-323), 2,3-dihydroxy-5methylthio-4-pentenoic acid ( b 52 0.020, P , 1.0E-323), C-glycosyltryptophan ( b 52 0.020, P , 1.5E-304), and pseudouridine ( b 52 0.018, P , 7.5E-294). All but pseudouridine were classi /uniFB01 ed into the amino acid superpathway. Amino acids and carbohydrates were overrepresented within the signi /uniFB01 cant serum metabolites (Figure 4A).\n\nBy contrast, top urine metabolites included those with negative associations with eGFR, 1-methylguanidine ( b 52 0.031, P 5 6.9E-202), asymmetric dimethylarginine ( b 5 0.013, P 5 5.3E-109), and X-12117 ( b 52 0.024, P 5 9.7E-102) and positive associations with eGFR, ribitol\n\n( b 5 0.014, P 5 5.8E-98), and guanine ( b 5 0.024, P 5 4.4E92). Amino acids and carbohydrates were also found to be over-represented within signi /uniFB01 cant urine metabolites (Figure 4B).\n\n## Cross-Sectional Associations between Serum or Urine Metabolites and Albuminuria\n\nThere were 75 serum and 91 urine metabolites that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with log2(UACR) (Figure 3, C and D), with seven signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites being shared between both bio /uniFB02 uids. For both bio /uniFB02 uids, the number of metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with log2(UACR) were fewer than the number of metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with eGFR. The top /uniFB01 ve signi /uniFB01 -cant serum metabolites cross-sectionally associated with log2(UACR) were 3,5-dichloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid ( b 52 0.15, P 5 2.0E-44); X-24951 ( b 52 0.21, P 5 9.0E-42); 3-bromo-5-chloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid ( b 52 0.13, P 5 2.1E-33); 4-hydroxychlorothalonil ( b 52 0.15, P 5 7.4E-30); and X-11372 ( b 52 0.12, P 5 6.3E-27), and all were negatively correlated with log2(UACR); each of these named metabolites were in the xenobiotic superpathway. Amino acids and carbohydrates were over-represented within signi /uniFB01 cant serum metabolites (Figure 4C).\n\nIn contrast to /uniFB01 ndings in serum, urine lipids were over-represented in metabolite associations with albuminuria (Figure 4D). The top /uniFB01 ve signi /uniFB01 cant urine metabolites included 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-glycerophosphatidylcholine (GPC) (16:0/20:4n6) ( b 5 0.35, P 5 3.2E-117), 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPC (16:0/18:2) ( b 5 0.39, P 5 5.7E-97), 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPC (18:0/18:2) ( b 5 0.39, P 5 2.5E-71), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylGPC (16:0/18:1) ( b 5 0.30, P 5 2.8E-43), and 1-stearoyl-2arachidonoyl-GPE (18:0/20:4) ( b 5 0.13, P 5 5.9E-25), all of which were lipids.\n\nFigure 1. Heat maps of the correlations and median correlations between every serum-urine metabolite pair, organized by superpathways. (A) Correlations between serum metabolites were more positive and generally stronger than correlations between urine metabolites or serum-urine metabolites. (B) Carbohydrates were most positively correlated with each other in serum (median correlation 0.2), urine (median correlation 0.06), and between biofluids (0.07). The strongest negative correlation was between serum carbohydrates and urine nucleotides (median correlation, 20.05). The superpathway abbreviations along the x axis and y axis are amino acid (AA), carbohydrate (Carb), cofactors and vitamins (Vit), energy (E), lipid (Lip), nucleotide (Nuc), partially characterized molecules (PCM), peptide (Pep), unknown (Un), and xenobiotics (Xen).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThere were /uniFB01 ve metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with both eGFR and log2(UACR) in both bio /uniFB02 uids: guanidinosuccinate; N2,N2-dimethylguanosine; hydroxyN6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine; X-13844; and X-25422 (see Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 for their associations). All /uniFB01 ve metabolites had negative associations with eGFR in both serum and urine. On the other hand, they were all positively associated with log2(UACR) in serum. In urine, guanidinosuccinate, X-13844, and X-25422 were positively associated with log2(UACR), whereas N2,N2dimethylguanosine and hydroxy-N6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine were negatively associated with log2(UACR).\n\n## Longitudinal Associations between Serum or Urine Metabolites and Kidney Function Decline\n\nNo serum or urine metabolite was signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with a 40% decline in eGFR at the Bonferroni-corrected threshold ( P for serum 5 4.0E-5, P for urine 5 3.6E-5) (Figure 5, A and B). Serum mannose (hazard ratio [HR] 5 2.3 [1.6 -3.2], P 5 2.7E-5) and urine X-12117 (HR 5 1.7 [1.3 -2.2], P 5 1.9E-5) were positively associated with UACR doubling, whereas urine sebacate (C10-DC) (HR 5 0.86 [0.80 -0.92], P 5 1.9E-5) was inversely associated with UACR doubling (Figure 5, C and D).\n\n## Evaluation of Effect Modification by Diabetes Status\n\nThe associations between metabolites and kidney function, albuminuria, and kidney function decline were comparable regardless of diabetes status (Supplemental Figure 3). On the other hand, several metabolites had higher or lower levels by diabetes status (Supplemental\n\nTable 3). Predictably, sugars and sugar compounds, such as glucose and mannonate, had elevated levels in serum and urine among individuals with diabetes. Several N -lactoyl amino acids previously found to be risk factors of diabetic retinopathy 25 were also elevated in both serum and urine for individuals with diabetes. Serum levels of choline-containing metabolites tended to be lower in participants with diabetes.\n\n## Benefit of Measuring Metabolites in Multiple Biofluids\n\nMetabolites that were detected in both serum and urine were more likely to be associated with eGFR than metabolites that were detected in only one of the bio /uniFB02 uids (84% metabolites detected in serum and urine were signi /uniFB01 cant versus 29% metabolites detected in serum only versus 31% metabolites detected in urine only, chisquared P 5 8.9E-114), indicating the centrality of metabolite excretion in kidney function (Figure 6). Similarly, for associations with albuminuria, more shared metabolites had signi /uniFB01 cant associations compared with those detected in a single bio /uniFB02 uid (16% versus 3% versus 4%, respectively, P 5 1.7E-20). A list of the metabolites that were detected in serum only, urine only, or both serum and urine is presented in Supplemental Table 4.\n\nThe top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites associated with a 40% decline in eGFR were 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG); cysteine s-sulfate; 10-undecenoate (11:1n1); erythronate; and 1-ribosyl-imidazoleacetate, whereas the top /uniFB01 ve urine metabolites were choline; 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate; N -acetylarginine; glycerophosphoethanolamine; and glucuronide of C10H18O2 (2).

Including serum and urine metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly increased the AUC further to 0.87 ( P for difference in AUCs between the clinical model and the clinical 1 serum 1 urine metabolites model 5 8.1E-6).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites associated with UACR doubling were mannose, N -acetylglycine, oleoylcholine, arachidonoylcholine, and g -glutamylcitrulline, whereas the top /uniFB01 ve urine metabolites were sebacate (C10-DC), I-urobilinogen, N -acetylglutamine, N -acetylcitrulline, and tridecenedioate (C13:1-DC). Including serum and urine metabolites in a prediction model of albuminuria doubling increased the AUC from 0.66 (clinical covariates only) to 0.69 (serum metabolites 1 clinical covariates, P for difference in AUC from the clinical covariates only model 5 0.012) and 0.71 (urine metabolites 1 clinical covariates, P for difference in AUC from the clinical covariates only model 5 3.6E-4). Including both serum and urine metabolites increased the AUC to 0.73 ( P for difference in AUC from the clinical covariates -only model 5 2.9E-5). To test the conclusion in an external cohort of participants with CKD, we used the same metabolites quanti /uniFB01 ed in plasma and urine in the GCKD study. Addition of blood or urine metabolomics improved risk prediction in the patients with CKD, albeit to a modest degree. Supplemental Table 5 contains the full equations for each of the above models for longitudinal risk prediction, and Supplemental Table 6 shows the Spearman correlations between the metabolites included in the models.\n\nThis large community-based study identi /uniFB01 es metabolomic correlates and antecedents of kidney parameters and kidney function decline, respectively, and suggests the utility of measuring metabolites in more than one bio /uniFB02 uid. Kidney function had a profound effect on both the circulating metabolome and the urinary metabolome. In addition, novel circulating and urinary metabolites were identi /uniFB01 ed that preceded the decline of kidney function more than 5 years in advance. Moreover, the results suggest that measurement of metabolites from multiple bio /uniFB02 uids can provide distinct and orthogonal insight into kidney disease biology and prognosis.\n\nMost prior metabolomics studies of kidney function have focused on blood metabolites and eGFR. 14,26,27 For example, a previous study discovered 65 circulating metabolites associated with eGFRcr. 14 Of the 65 metabolites, 49 were measured in our study and all displayed signi /uniFB01 cant associations with eGFRcr-cys ( P , 0.05/49), providing face validity. Similarly, several of the top serum metabolites are known markers of /uniFB01 ltration: creatinine, pseudouridine, and C-glycosyltryptophan. 28,29 Other /uniFB01 ndings expand upon the existing literature: Serum guanidinosuccinate, previously associated with kidney failure, was negatively associated with eGFR and positively associated with albuminuria. 30,31 Serum N2,N2dimethylguanosine, a modi /uniFB01 ed ribonucleoside known to be elevated in kidney failure, was associated with worse kidney function and albuminuria doubling. 32 We also found that higher levels of choline and its derivatives, such as trimethylamine N -oxide, were risk factors of kidney function or kidney function decline, although the latter associations were NS at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold. This association is consistent with various studies that have identi /uniFB01 ed choline and its derivatives as markers of renal metabolism 33 that are upregulated in AKI. 34\n\nFigure 3.

UACR, urine albumin-creatinine ratio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur results expand upon previous /uniFB01 ndings by adding metabolomic pro /uniFB01 ling of urine, which has been investigated in markedly fewer studies. Many of the known uremic toxins, or metabolites that accumulate in serum in the setting of low eGFR ( e.g ., urea, indoxyl sulfate, kynurenines), also had negative associations with eGFR in urine. This suggests that for these metabolites, absolute levels of excretion are higher in lower eGFR, albeit insuf /uniFB01 cient to maintain a normal nonelevated level in blood. Notably, higher levels of metabolites in blood could re /uniFB02 ect retention or systemic overproduction. 35\n\nEight of the ten metabolite superpathways were overrepresented in at least one of the four cross-sectional analyses for serum or urine metabolite associations with eGFR or albuminuria. Among the metabolites associated with albuminuria, urinary lipids were over-represented. Several\n\nFigure 4.

The top percentage given above each bar is the proportion of metabolites in the superpathway within all metabolites, whereas the bottom percentage is the proportion of significant metabolites in the superpathway within all significant metabolites (not within each superpathway or within all metabolites).

Phosphatidylcholines are essential components of biological membranes and critical for LDL and chylomicron assembly. GPCs are also osmolytes that accumulate under hypertonic stress, which can occur in the setting of low kidney function, leading to increased levels of excretion into urine. Their increased presence in urine in the setting of albuminuria may represent damaged cell membranes or coupling with urine albumin because albumin has a high af /uniFB01 nity for lipids. 36 38 -High levels of lipids may also indicate dyslipidemia or abnormal lipid metabolism, which may cause or accelerate lipotoxicity-mediated atherosclerotic renal vascular damage, leading to albuminuria. 39 42 -\n\nMany of the metabolites detected in both serum and urine were associated with eGFR and albuminuria, which may be a direct re /uniFB02 ection of the kidney s role in ' /uniFB01 ltration. The metabolites with highest correlation between serum and urine levels were xenobiotics. Interestingly, most\n\nUrine metabolites\n\nFigure 5.

This may re /uniFB02 ect the fact that urine levels are determined not only by /uniFB01 ltration but also by tubular secretion. Although GFR associates with the secretory clearance of drugs, 43 the relationship can be nonlinear for speci /uniFB01 c solutes, especially in advanced CKD. 44 More likely, however, is that blood levels of intravascular hydration are extraordinarily well regulated, whereas urine has a wide range of dilution that statistical methods ( e.g ., PQ normalization) can only partially address.\n\nIn longitudinal analyses, higher serum mannose and lower urine sebacate was a strong risk factor of increasing albuminuria, quanti /uniFB01 ed by UACR doubling. Previous kidney metabolomic studies have reported positive associations between serum mannose with kidney failure 45\n\nFigure 6.

Urine sebacate is a naturally occurring urine acid, and dibutyl sebacate is a common plasticizer used in the coating of sustained-release drug tablets. 47 -51 Thus, higher levels of urinary sebacate may re /uniFB02 ect use of speci /uniFB01 c medications.\n\nAlthough the aim of this work was not focused on prediction of CKD progression, simple logistic models including either serum metabolites or urine metabolites improved discrimination over a model of clinical covariates only, and the model including both serum and urine metabolites had the best discrimination among all models considered. This /uniFB01 nding was replicated in patients with CKD in the GCKD cohort. Although these /uniFB01 ndings require validation in independent studies, they lend credence to the idea that not only do both bio /uniFB02 uids provide key information in estimating kidney prognosis but also the information they provide is complementary.\n\nThis study re /uniFB02 ects one of the largest to date to use both serum and urine metabolites in the cross-sectional and longitudinal assessment of kidney function. Serum and urine metabolites were identi /uniFB01 ed using the same metabolomics platform and encompassed over 700 shared metabolites. However, there are several limitations of our study. Our analyses used covariates that were selfreported (hypertension medication, smoking). Because our study cohort included participants with an average baseline age of 76 years, average eGFR of above 60 ml/min per 1.73 m , as well as Black and White indi2 viduals only, our results may not be generalizable to younger populations, populations with higher prevalence of kidney disease, or other racial/ethnic groups. Because the liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy quanti -/uniFB01 -cation was relative, not absolute, we did not assess for associations between the fractional excretion of metabolites and kidney function or kidney function decline. Confounders may be measured incompletely and with error, and there may be additional confounders that were not included. For example, analyses of the effect of diet and fasting status on our /uniFB01 ndings were not conducted; previous studies in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension-Sodium trial have suggested that there may be differences in in /uniFB02 uential serum and urine biomarkers by dietary patterns. 52,53 The multimetabolite model of kidney function decline was designed to investigate the potential utility of including metabolites from both urine and serum; if optimal discrimination were the aim, performance might be further improved with a method, such as elastic net regression, that includes criteria for intermetabolite correlations. ARIC is a general population cohort of older participants, whereas GCKD consists of individuals diagnosed with CKD; the differences in the sample characteristics between the ARIC and GCKD cohorts may in /uniFB02 uence the validity of our replication.\n\nIn summary, we provide a comprehensive atlas of serum and urine metabolite associations with eGFR and albuminuria cross-sectionally and longitudinally in a large\n\n## Table 2.

All analyses were adjusted for clinical and demographic covariates, including for baseline eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) in longitudinal analyses.\n\nResults At visit 5 of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, the mean age of participants was 76 years (SD 6); 56% were women, mean eGFR was 62 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 20), and median UACR level was 13 mg/g (interquartile range, 25). In cross-sectional analysis, 675 serum and 542 urine metabolites were associated with eGFR (Bonferroni-corrected P , 4.0E-5 for serum analyses and P , 3.6E-5 for urine analyses), including 248 metabolites shared across bio /uniFB02 uids. Fewer metabolites (75 serum and 91 urine metabolites, including seven metabolites shared across bio /uniFB02 uids) were cross-sectionally associated with albuminuria. Guanidinosuccinate; N2,N2-dimethylguanosine; hydroxy-N6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine; X-13844; and X-25422 were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with both eGFR and albuminuria. Over a mean follow-up of 6.6 years, serum mannose (hazard ratio [HR], 2.3 [1.6 -3.2], P 5 2.7E-5) and urine X-12117 (HR, 1.7 [1.3 -2.2], P 5 1.9E-5) were risk factors of UACR doubling, whereas urine sebacate (HR, 0.86 [0.80 -0.92], P 5 1.9E-5) was inversely associated. Compared with clinical characteristics alone, including the top /uniFB01 ve endogenous metabolites in serum and urine associated with longitudinal outcomes improved the outcome prediction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for eGFR decline: clinical model 5 0.79, clinical 1 metabolites model 5 0.87, P 5 8.1E-6; for UACR doubling: clinical model 5 0.66, clinical 1 metabolites model 5 0.73, P 5 2.9E-5).\n\nConclusions Metabolomic pro /uniFB01 ling in different bio /uniFB02 uids provided distinct and potentially complementary insights into the biology and prognosis of kidney diseases.\n\nJASN 35: 1252 -1265, 2024. doi: https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.0000000000000403\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe kidney is an organ that interfaces between blood and urine, and its function is quanti /uniFB01 ed by the accumulation and /uniFB02 ow of small molecules or metabolites across bio /uniFB02 uids. eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) are two metrics commonly used to quantify kidney function and injury, with both metrics incorporating creatinine, a small molecule that is both /uniFB01 ltered and secreted by the kidney. Low eGFR and high UACR levels are associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes, such as kidney failure and mortality. 1 4 -\n\nMetabolomics refers to the large-scale identi /uniFB01 cation and quanti /uniFB01 cation of metabolites in biological systems. This tool, to date primarily implemented in blood, has allowed for the discovery of circulating biomarkers associated with clinical outcomes, such as CKD. 5 8 -Given the kidney s role in ' /uniFB01 ltration, both serum and urine metabolomic investigations may inform the study of kidney diseases.\n\nDue to the number of contributing authors, the affiliations are listed at the end of this article.\n\nCorrespondence: Dr. Morgan E. Grams or Dr. Pascal Schlosser, email: Morgan.Grams@nyulangone.org or pascal.schlosser@uniklinik-freiburg.de\n\nReceived: February 16, 2024 Accepted: May 29, 2024 Published Online Ahead of Print: June 6, 2024\n\nIn addition to creatinine, other serum or urine-based metabolites may add information regarding kidney function, injury, or prognosis.\n\nA few previous kidney metabolomic studies have considered metabolites pro /uniFB01 led within serum and urine, but sample size or the metabolomic platform was limited or data restricted to blood levels. 9 14 -In this study, we aimed to identify non-drug serum and urine metabolites that were crosssectionally associated with eGFR or UACR, as well as metabolites that were longitudinally associated with a 40% decline in eGFR or UACR doubling in a large general population cohort. We assessed these associations using the same high-throughput metabolomics platform for 1255 and 1398 metabolites in serum and urine, respectively. We also aimed to assess whether including serum, urine, or both sets of metabolites with clinical variables can improve the performance of models predicting kidney function decline.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Study Population\n\nThe Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study is an ongoing study that began in 1987 that aims to investigate causes and clinical consequences of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases with respect to demographic characteristics. 15 The study recruited 15,792 participants aged between 45 and 64 years at enrollment (visit 1) from four communities (Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; Minneapolis suburbs, MN; and Washington County, MD).\n\nOur study population was drawn from the 6538 ARIC participants who attended visit 5 (2011 -2013). To be included in the current analyses, we required that participants had non-missing eGFRcr,cys ( n 5 101 excluded), were in either the White or Black race category ( n 5 18 excluded), had no prevalent kidney failure ( n 5 36 excluded), and had both serum and urine metabolite data available with at least 50% detectable endogenous metabolites (Supplemental Figure 1). This selection resulted in a study sample of 1612 participants used in cross-sectional analyses.\n\nFor the longitudinal analyses with a 40% decline in eGFR or UACR doubling, we required that participants had at least one follow-up visit at visit 6 (2016 -2017) or 7 (2018 -2019) with non-missing eGFR or UACR data. This resulted in 942 individuals in our study population for the decline in eGFR analysis and 894 individuals for the doubling in UACR analyses. ARIC conducted active surveillance and is linked to mortality and the United States Renal Data System registries.\n\nTo assess whether including serum, urine, or both sets of metabolites improved prediction of eGFR decline or UACR doubling beyond clinical variables, individuals common to both longitudinal study samples were included ( n 5 879).\n\nReplication of longitudinal analyses were conducted in the ongoing prospective German Chronic Kidney Disease (GCKD) study, which began in 2010 and enrolled 5217 adult individuals with CKD. 16 Inclusion criteria encompassed patients regularly visited by nephrologists, with an eGFR between 30 and 60 ml min 2 1 per 1.73 m 2 or an eGFR . 60 ml min 2 1 per 1.73 m 2 along with UACR . 300 mg per gram (or urinary protein-creatinine ratio . 500 mg per gram). The GCKD study was registered in the national clinical studies registry (DRKS 00003971) and received approval from the local ethics committees at participating institutions (universities or medical faculties of Aachen, Berlin, Erlangen, Freiburg, Hannover, Heidelberg, Jena, Munchen, and Wurzburg). \u0308 \u0308 All participants provided written informed consent.\n\n## Metabolomic Profiling and Preprocessing\n\nSerum and urine samples stored at 2 80\u00b0C were sent to Metabolon, Inc. (Durham, NC) for untargeted metabolite pro /uniFB01 ling by liquid chromatography -mass spectroscopy (serum pro /uniFB01 led in 2019, urine pro /uniFB01 led in 2022). A total of 1464 serum metabolites (including 320 unnamed and 302 drug metabolites) and 1581 urine metabolites (including 467 unnamed and 382 drug metabolites) were identi /uniFB01 ed and quanti /uniFB01 ed. Metabolites were categorized into ten superpathways by Metabolon, namely amino acid, carbohydrate, cofactors and vitamins, energy, lipid, nucleotide, partially characterized molecules, peptide, unknown, and xenobiotics. Drug metabolites were excluded from our analyses (serum: 302 metabolites, urine: 382 metabolites). The preprocessing steps for serum and urine data were conducted in parallel.\n\nFirst, for both serum and urine data, each metabolite was batch normalized to account for minor instrument variations between batches per manufacturer protocol (Metabolon, Inc.). Missing values were imputed with the minimum observed value for endogenous and unnamed metabolites present in more than 20% of samples.\n\nFor urine data only, we accounted for the varying dilutions between samples using probability quotient (PQ) normalization. 17 In the context of urine metabolomics, PQ normalization operates by /uniFB01 nding a most probable dilution factor estimated from a low-missingness subset of metabolites to normalize each sample. We estimated our PQ factors for normalization on the basis of all 372 endogenous metabolites with , 1% missing sample measurements. The PQ factors were computed with the nonimputed data of these metabolites and then used to normalize the samples for the imputed urine data. In Supplemental Figure 2, we provide a plot of the PQ factors against urinary creatinine, the reference that is used clinically. 18,19\n\nFor both serum and urine data, we then rescaled each metabolite to have a median of 1 and then log2 transformed the metabolites to reduce skewness. Metabolites with variance # 0.01 were removed, and endogenous and unnamed metabolites were winsorized at 5 SDs. Finally, we excluded any metabolites with . 80% missing sample measurements.\n\nThe /uniFB01 nal dataset consisted of 1255 serum metabolites and 1398 urine metabolites, with 721 metabolites detected in both bio /uniFB02 uids.\n\nGCKDmetabolomics were quanti /uniFB01 ed from stored EDTA plasma and spot urine. Preprocessing was conducted analogously, except for winsorization, which was not performed. 20 The /uniFB01 nal dataset for the selected plasma and urine metabolites consisted of 4744 individuals with complete data.\n\n## Covariates\n\nStudy center included four categories as mentioned earlier: Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; Minneapolis suburbs, MN;andWashington County, MD. Diabetes was de /uniFB01 ned as having a blood glucose level of $ 140 mg/dl after a fasting\n\nperiod of $ 8 hours or a nonfasting blood glucose level of $ 200 mg/dl, a self-reported clinical diagnosis of diabetes, or taking medications for diabetes or high blood glucose. Systolic BP was determined using the average of the second and third sitting BP measurements of three total measurements that were taken 5 minutes apart with no change in posture. Prevalent coronary heart disease was de /uniFB01 ned as having prevalent myocardial infarction from adjudicated electrocardiogram data in visit 5, diagnosed myocardial infarction, or a history of coronary bypass or angioplasty of a coronary artery/arteries. Age, sex, race, and smoking status (current smoker, former smoker, never smoked, or unknown) were self-reported. The use of hypertension medications was ascertained by inspection of medications taken in the previous 2 weeks. The race-free 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation 21 was used to calculate the eGFR for each visit using both serum creatinine and cystatin C. Creatinine was measured using the Roche enzymatic method, whereas cystatin C was measured by immunoturbidimetry. Urine albumin (used to calculate urine albumin-creatinine ratios [UACR], i.e ., albuminuria) at each visit was quanti /uniFB01 ed by immunoturbidimetry from random urine samples. Total cholesterol, weight, and height (the latter two used to de /uniFB01 ne body mass index) were measured during visit 5. GCKD used the 2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation based on serum creatinine. 22\n\n## Statistical Analysis\n\nBaseline characteristics of the study population were summarized using means and SDs or medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for skewed distributions and for continuous variables, respectively. Categorical variables were summarized with counts and proportions. To characterize the serum and urine metabolome on a descriptive level before integrating kidney function, metabolites were sorted by their superpathways and the Spearman correlations between all pairs of metabolites were calculated. The median correlations by superpathway were then calculated excluding paired serum -serum and urine -urine metabolites that have a correlation of 1. Summary statistics of the correlations by superpathways for paired serum -urine metabolites were separately reported.\n\nIn the cross-sectional analyses to investigate associations between metabolites within each bio /uniFB02 uid and eGFR or log2(UACR), sequentially adjusted multiple linear regression models were implemented: model 1 adjusted for demographics only, that is, age, sex, race, and study center; model 2 adjusted additionally for body mass index, systolic BP, diabetes, prevalent coronary heart disease, use of hypertension medications, smoking status, and total cholesterol; model 3 adjusted additionally for log2(UACR) when assessing associations with eGFR or eGFR when assessing associations with log2(UACR).\n\nTo assess whether speci /uniFB01 c superpathways were overrepresented among the metabolites that were associated with eGFR or UACR, a permutation test was performed by repeating the regression analyses over all metabolites for a total of 1000 times. 23 Metabolite levels were permuted en bloc to retain the same correlation structure. In other words, the data structure was retained, but eGFR (or UACR)\n\nwas permuted for a total of 1000 permutations. In each permutation, all metabolite regressions were performed. The number of signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites from the original analysis was used to identify the top associations from each permutation. A superpathway was determined to be over-represented if the original number of signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites in the superpathway was greater than the number of signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites in the same superpathway in more than 95% of the permutations ( P , 0.05).\n\nIn the longitudinal analyses to investigate associations between metabolites within each bio /uniFB02 uid and 40% eGFR decline or UACR doubling from visit 5 by visit 7 (mean follow-up time of 6.6 years), three sequentially adjusted logistic regression models were considered as before. Of note, model 3 adjusted for both baseline eGFR and log2(UACR) in both analyses.\n\nMultiple tests were accounted for using a Bonferronicorrected threshold to assess for statistical signi /uniFB01 cance. Signi /uniFB01 cant serum metabolites were de /uniFB01 ned to have P , 0.05/ 1255 5 4.0E-5, whereas signi /uniFB01 cant urine metabolites were de /uniFB01 ned to have P , 0.05/1397 5 3.6E-5.\n\nMetabolites found to be signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with kidney function or kidney function decline were reassessed with model 3 in individuals strati /uniFB01 ed by diabetes status, excluding the diabetes adjustment.\n\nTo investigate whether including both urine and serum metabolites in a logistic model for a 40% decline in eGFR or UACR doubling improved discrimination as compared with clinical covariates, we /uniFB01 rst de /uniFB01 ned a model using clinical covariates described in model 3 of the longitudinal analyses, assessing performance using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Then, we evaluated models with clinical covariates 1 the top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites only, clinical covariates 1 the top /uniFB01 ve urine metabolites only, and clinical covariates 1 the top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites and top /uniFB01 veurine metabolites. The top metabolites were selected from endogenous metabolites with the lowest P values from model 3 of the longitudinal analyses. Model improvement was assessed using the difference in AUC (DeLong test). 24 GCKDanalyses did not include race and center as covariates.\n\n## Results\n\n## Baseline Characteristics of Study Populations\n\nThe study population for the cross-sectional analyses included 1612 participants with a mean age of 76 years (SD 6); 56% were women, 49% were Black, mean eGFR was 62 ml/ min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 20), and median UACR was 13 mg/g (IQR, 25) (Table 1).\n\nFor longitudinal analyses with eGFR decline as the outcome, the study population with 942 participants had a mean age of 75 years (SD 5); 59% were female, 54% were Black, the mean eGFR was 65 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 20), and the median UACR was 10 mg/g (IQR, 18). The mean time between visits was 3.4 years, and 10% ( n 5 97) people developed a 40% decline in eGFR, whereas 33% ( n 5 294) people developed doubling of UACR.\n\n## Metabolite-Metabolite Correlations\n\nIntermetabolite correlation varied across superpathways (Figure 1A).

Metabolites within the xenobiotic superpathway had the highest correlations between serum and urine (median, 0.79; IQR, 0.19) (Figure 2B), potentially indicating the primacy of renal excretion and limited endogenous metabolism for these compounds.\n\n## Cross-Sectional Associations between Serum or Urine Metabolites and Kidney Function\n\nThere were 675 and 542 serum and urine metabolites that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with eGFR (Figure 3, A and B), including 248 shared metabolites. A higher proportion of serum metabolites were inversely associated with eGFR compared with urine metabolites (71% for serum versus 56% for urine), representing accumulation of many metabolites in lower eGFR.\n\nTop metabolites that were higher with lower eGFR included creatinine ( b 52 0.014, P , 1.0E-323), hydroxyasparagine ( b 52 0.020, P , 1.0E-323), 2,3-dihydroxy-5methylthio-4-pentenoic acid ( b 52 0.020, P , 1.0E-323), C-glycosyltryptophan ( b 52 0.020, P , 1.5E-304), and pseudouridine ( b 52 0.018, P , 7.5E-294). All but pseudouridine were classi /uniFB01 ed into the amino acid superpathway. Amino acids and carbohydrates were overrepresented within the signi /uniFB01 cant serum metabolites (Figure 4A).\n\nBy contrast, top urine metabolites included those with negative associations with eGFR, 1-methylguanidine ( b 52 0.031, P 5 6.9E-202), asymmetric dimethylarginine ( b 5 0.013, P 5 5.3E-109), and X-12117 ( b 52 0.024, P 5 9.7E-102) and positive associations with eGFR, ribitol\n\n( b 5 0.014, P 5 5.8E-98), and guanine ( b 5 0.024, P 5 4.4E92). Amino acids and carbohydrates were also found to be over-represented within signi /uniFB01 cant urine metabolites (Figure 4B).\n\n## Cross-Sectional Associations between Serum or Urine Metabolites and Albuminuria\n\nThere were 75 serum and 91 urine metabolites that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with log2(UACR) (Figure 3, C and D), with seven signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites being shared between both bio /uniFB02 uids. For both bio /uniFB02 uids, the number of metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with log2(UACR) were fewer than the number of metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with eGFR. The top /uniFB01 ve signi /uniFB01 -cant serum metabolites cross-sectionally associated with log2(UACR) were 3,5-dichloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid ( b 52 0.15, P 5 2.0E-44); X-24951 ( b 52 0.21, P 5 9.0E-42); 3-bromo-5-chloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid ( b 52 0.13, P 5 2.1E-33); 4-hydroxychlorothalonil ( b 52 0.15, P 5 7.4E-30); and X-11372 ( b 52 0.12, P 5 6.3E-27), and all were negatively correlated with log2(UACR); each of these named metabolites were in the xenobiotic superpathway. Amino acids and carbohydrates were over-represented within signi /uniFB01 cant serum metabolites (Figure 4C).\n\nIn contrast to /uniFB01 ndings in serum, urine lipids were over-represented in metabolite associations with albuminuria (Figure 4D). The top /uniFB01 ve signi /uniFB01 cant urine metabolites included 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-glycerophosphatidylcholine (GPC) (16:0/20:4n6) ( b 5 0.35, P 5 3.2E-117), 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPC (16:0/18:2) ( b 5 0.39, P 5 5.7E-97), 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPC (18:0/18:2) ( b 5 0.39, P 5 2.5E-71), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylGPC (16:0/18:1) ( b 5 0.30, P 5 2.8E-43), and 1-stearoyl-2arachidonoyl-GPE (18:0/20:4) ( b 5 0.13, P 5 5.9E-25), all of which were lipids.\n\nFigure 1. Heat maps of the correlations and median correlations between every serum-urine metabolite pair, organized by superpathways. (A) Correlations between serum metabolites were more positive and generally stronger than correlations between urine metabolites or serum-urine metabolites. (B) Carbohydrates were most positively correlated with each other in serum (median correlation 0.2), urine (median correlation 0.06), and between biofluids (0.07). The strongest negative correlation was between serum carbohydrates and urine nucleotides (median correlation, 20.05). The superpathway abbreviations along the x axis and y axis are amino acid (AA), carbohydrate (Carb), cofactors and vitamins (Vit), energy (E), lipid (Lip), nucleotide (Nuc), partially characterized molecules (PCM), peptide (Pep), unknown (Un), and xenobiotics (Xen).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThere were /uniFB01 ve metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with both eGFR and log2(UACR) in both bio /uniFB02 uids: guanidinosuccinate; N2,N2-dimethylguanosine; hydroxyN6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine; X-13844; and X-25422 (see Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 for their associations). All /uniFB01 ve metabolites had negative associations with eGFR in both serum and urine. On the other hand, they were all positively associated with log2(UACR) in serum. In urine, guanidinosuccinate, X-13844, and X-25422 were positively associated with log2(UACR), whereas N2,N2dimethylguanosine and hydroxy-N6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine were negatively associated with log2(UACR).\n\n## Longitudinal Associations between Serum or Urine Metabolites and Kidney Function Decline\n\nNo serum or urine metabolite was signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with a 40% decline in eGFR at the Bonferroni-corrected threshold ( P for serum 5 4.0E-5, P for urine 5 3.6E-5) (Figure 5, A and B). Serum mannose (hazard ratio [HR] 5 2.3 [1.6 -3.2], P 5 2.7E-5) and urine X-12117 (HR 5 1.7 [1.3 -2.2], P 5 1.9E-5) were positively associated with UACR doubling, whereas urine sebacate (C10-DC) (HR 5 0.86 [0.80 -0.92], P 5 1.9E-5) was inversely associated with UACR doubling (Figure 5, C and D).\n\n## Evaluation of Effect Modification by Diabetes Status\n\nThe associations between metabolites and kidney function, albuminuria, and kidney function decline were comparable regardless of diabetes status (Supplemental Figure 3). On the other hand, several metabolites had higher or lower levels by diabetes status (Supplemental\n\nTable 3). Predictably, sugars and sugar compounds, such as glucose and mannonate, had elevated levels in serum and urine among individuals with diabetes. Several N -lactoyl amino acids previously found to be risk factors of diabetic retinopathy 25 were also elevated in both serum and urine for individuals with diabetes. Serum levels of choline-containing metabolites tended to be lower in participants with diabetes.\n\n## Benefit of Measuring Metabolites in Multiple Biofluids\n\nMetabolites that were detected in both serum and urine were more likely to be associated with eGFR than metabolites that were detected in only one of the bio /uniFB02 uids (84% metabolites detected in serum and urine were signi /uniFB01 cant versus 29% metabolites detected in serum only versus 31% metabolites detected in urine only, chisquared P 5 8.9E-114), indicating the centrality of metabolite excretion in kidney function (Figure 6). Similarly, for associations with albuminuria, more shared metabolites had signi /uniFB01 cant associations compared with those detected in a single bio /uniFB02 uid (16% versus 3% versus 4%, respectively, P 5 1.7E-20). A list of the metabolites that were detected in serum only, urine only, or both serum and urine is presented in Supplemental Table 4.\n\nThe top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites associated with a 40% decline in eGFR were 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG); cysteine s-sulfate; 10-undecenoate (11:1n1); erythronate; and 1-ribosyl-imidazoleacetate, whereas the top /uniFB01 ve urine metabolites were choline; 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate; N -acetylarginine; glycerophosphoethanolamine; and glucuronide of C10H18O2 (2).

Including serum and urine metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly increased the AUC further to 0.87 ( P for difference in AUCs between the clinical model and the clinical 1 serum 1 urine metabolites model 5 8.1E-6).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites associated with UACR doubling were mannose, N -acetylglycine, oleoylcholine, arachidonoylcholine, and g -glutamylcitrulline, whereas the top /uniFB01 ve urine metabolites were sebacate (C10-DC), I-urobilinogen, N -acetylglutamine, N -acetylcitrulline, and tridecenedioate (C13:1-DC). Including serum and urine metabolites in a prediction model of albuminuria doubling increased the AUC from 0.66 (clinical covariates only) to 0.69 (serum metabolites 1 clinical covariates, P for difference in AUC from the clinical covariates only model 5 0.012) and 0.71 (urine metabolites 1 clinical covariates, P for difference in AUC from the clinical covariates only model 5 3.6E-4). Including both serum and urine metabolites increased the AUC to 0.73 ( P for difference in AUC from the clinical covariates -only model 5 2.9E-5). To test the conclusion in an external cohort of participants with CKD, we used the same metabolites quanti /uniFB01 ed in plasma and urine in the GCKD study. Addition of blood or urine metabolomics improved risk prediction in the patients with CKD, albeit to a modest degree. Supplemental Table 5 contains the full equations for each of the above models for longitudinal risk prediction, and Supplemental Table 6 shows the Spearman correlations between the metabolites included in the models.\n\nThis large community-based study identi /uniFB01 es metabolomic correlates and antecedents of kidney parameters and kidney function decline, respectively, and suggests the utility of measuring metabolites in more than one bio /uniFB02 uid. Kidney function had a profound effect on both the circulating metabolome and the urinary metabolome. In addition, novel circulating and urinary metabolites were identi /uniFB01 ed that preceded the decline of kidney function more than 5 years in advance. Moreover, the results suggest that measurement of metabolites from multiple bio /uniFB02 uids can provide distinct and orthogonal insight into kidney disease biology and prognosis.\n\nMost prior metabolomics studies of kidney function have focused on blood metabolites and eGFR. 14,26,27 For example, a previous study discovered 65 circulating metabolites associated with eGFRcr. 14 Of the 65 metabolites, 49 were measured in our study and all displayed signi /uniFB01 cant associations with eGFRcr-cys ( P , 0.05/49), providing face validity. Similarly, several of the top serum metabolites are known markers of /uniFB01 ltration: creatinine, pseudouridine, and C-glycosyltryptophan. 28,29 Other /uniFB01 ndings expand upon the existing literature: Serum guanidinosuccinate, previously associated with kidney failure, was negatively associated with eGFR and positively associated with albuminuria. 30,31 Serum N2,N2dimethylguanosine, a modi /uniFB01 ed ribonucleoside known to be elevated in kidney failure, was associated with worse kidney function and albuminuria doubling. 32 We also found that higher levels of choline and its derivatives, such as trimethylamine N -oxide, were risk factors of kidney function or kidney function decline, although the latter associations were NS at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold. This association is consistent with various studies that have identi /uniFB01 ed choline and its derivatives as markers of renal metabolism 33 that are upregulated in AKI. 34\n\nFigure 3.

Many of the known uremic toxins, or metabolites that accumulate in serum in the setting of low eGFR ( e.g ., urea, indoxyl sulfate, kynurenines), also had negative associations with eGFR in urine. This suggests that for these metabolites, absolute levels of excretion are higher in lower eGFR, albeit insuf /uniFB01 cient to maintain a normal nonelevated level in blood. Notably, higher levels of metabolites in blood could re /uniFB02 ect retention or systemic overproduction. 35\n\nEight of the ten metabolite superpathways were overrepresented in at least one of the four cross-sectional analyses for serum or urine metabolite associations with eGFR or albuminuria. Among the metabolites associated with albuminuria, urinary lipids were over-represented. Several\n\nFigure 4.

The top percentage given above each bar is the proportion of metabolites in the superpathway within all metabolites, whereas the bottom percentage is the proportion of significant metabolites in the superpathway within all significant metabolites (not within each superpathway or within all metabolites).

Phosphatidylcholines are essential components of biological membranes and critical for LDL and chylomicron assembly. GPCs are also osmolytes that accumulate under hypertonic stress, which can occur in the setting of low kidney function, leading to increased levels of excretion into urine. Their increased presence in urine in the setting of albuminuria may represent damaged cell membranes or coupling with urine albumin because albumin has a high af /uniFB01 nity for lipids. 36 38 -High levels of lipids may also indicate dyslipidemia or abnormal lipid metabolism, which may cause or accelerate lipotoxicity-mediated atherosclerotic renal vascular damage, leading to albuminuria. 39 42 -\n\nMany of the metabolites detected in both serum and urine were associated with eGFR and albuminuria, which may be a direct re /uniFB02 ection of the kidney s role in ' /uniFB01 ltration. The metabolites with highest correlation between serum and urine levels were xenobiotics. Interestingly, most\n\nUrine metabolites\n\nFigure 5.

This may re /uniFB02 ect the fact that urine levels are determined not only by /uniFB01 ltration but also by tubular secretion. Although GFR associates with the secretory clearance of drugs, 43 the relationship can be nonlinear for speci /uniFB01 c solutes, especially in advanced CKD. 44 More likely, however, is that blood levels of intravascular hydration are extraordinarily well regulated, whereas urine has a wide range of dilution that statistical methods ( e.g ., PQ normalization) can only partially address.\n\nIn longitudinal analyses, higher serum mannose and lower urine sebacate was a strong risk factor of increasing albuminuria, quanti /uniFB01 ed by UACR doubling. Previous kidney metabolomic studies have reported positive associations between serum mannose with kidney failure 45\n\nFigure 6.

Urine sebacate is a naturally occurring urine acid, and dibutyl sebacate is a common plasticizer used in the coating of sustained-release drug tablets. 47 -51 Thus, higher levels of urinary sebacate may re /uniFB02 ect use of speci /uniFB01 c medications.\n\nAlthough the aim of this work was not focused on prediction of CKD progression, simple logistic models including either serum metabolites or urine metabolites improved discrimination over a model of clinical covariates only, and the model including both serum and urine metabolites had the best discrimination among all models considered. This /uniFB01 nding was replicated in patients with CKD in the GCKD cohort. Although these /uniFB01 ndings require validation in independent studies, they lend credence to the idea that not only do both bio /uniFB02 uids provide key information in estimating kidney prognosis but also the information they provide is complementary.\n\nThis study re /uniFB02 ects one of the largest to date to use both serum and urine metabolites in the cross-sectional and longitudinal assessment of kidney function. Serum and urine metabolites were identi /uniFB01 ed using the same metabolomics platform and encompassed over 700 shared metabolites. However, there are several limitations of our study. Our analyses used covariates that were selfreported (hypertension medication, smoking). Because our study cohort included participants with an average baseline age of 76 years, average eGFR of above 60 ml/min per 1.73 m , as well as Black and White indi2 viduals only, our results may not be generalizable to younger populations, populations with higher prevalence of kidney disease, or other racial/ethnic groups. Because the liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy quanti -/uniFB01 -cation was relative, not absolute, we did not assess for associations between the fractional excretion of metabolites and kidney function or kidney function decline. Confounders may be measured incompletely and with error, and there may be additional confounders that were not included. For example, analyses of the effect of diet and fasting status on our /uniFB01 ndings were not conducted; previous studies in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension-Sodium trial have suggested that there may be differences in in /uniFB02 uential serum and urine biomarkers by dietary patterns. 52,53 The multimetabolite model of kidney function decline was designed to investigate the potential utility of including metabolites from both urine and serum; if optimal discrimination were the aim, performance might be further improved with a method, such as elastic net regression, that includes criteria for intermetabolite correlations. ARIC is a general population cohort of older participants, whereas GCKD consists of individuals diagnosed with CKD; the differences in the sample characteristics between the ARIC and GCKD cohorts may in /uniFB02 uence the validity of our replication.\n\nIn summary, we provide a comprehensive atlas of serum and urine metabolite associations with eGFR and albuminuria cross-sectionally and longitudinally in a large\n\n## Table 2.

All analyses were adjusted for clinical and demographic covariates, including for baseline eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) in longitudinal analyses.\n\nResults At visit 5 of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, the mean age of participants was 76 years (SD 6); 56% were women, mean eGFR was 62 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 20), and median UACR level was 13 mg/g (interquartile range, 25). In cross-sectional analysis, 675 serum and 542 urine metabolites were associated with eGFR (Bonferroni-corrected P , 4.0E-5 for serum analyses and P , 3.6E-5 for urine analyses), including 248 metabolites shared across bio /uniFB02 uids. Fewer metabolites (75 serum and 91 urine metabolites, including seven metabolites shared across bio /uniFB02 uids) were cross-sectionally associated with albuminuria. Guanidinosuccinate; N2,N2-dimethylguanosine; hydroxy-N6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine; X-13844; and X-25422 were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with both eGFR and albuminuria. Over a mean follow-up of 6.6 years, serum mannose (hazard ratio [HR], 2.3 [1.6 -3.2], P 5 2.7E-5) and urine X-12117 (HR, 1.7 [1.3 -2.2], P 5 1.9E-5) were risk factors of UACR doubling, whereas urine sebacate (HR, 0.86 [0.80 -0.92], P 5 1.9E-5) was inversely associated. Compared with clinical characteristics alone, including the top /uniFB01 ve endogenous metabolites in serum and urine associated with longitudinal outcomes improved the outcome prediction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for eGFR decline: clinical model 5 0.79, clinical 1 metabolites model 5 0.87, P 5 8.1E-6; for UACR doubling: clinical model 5 0.66, clinical 1 metabolites model 5 0.73, P 5 2.9E-5).\n\nConclusions Metabolomic pro /uniFB01 ling in different bio /uniFB02 uids provided distinct and potentially complementary insights into the biology and prognosis of kidney diseases.\n\nJASN 35: 1252 -1265, 2024. doi: https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.0000000000000403\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe kidney is an organ that interfaces between blood and urine, and its function is quanti /uniFB01 ed by the accumulation and /uniFB02 ow of small molecules or metabolites across bio /uniFB02 uids. eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) are two metrics commonly used to quantify kidney function and injury, with both metrics incorporating creatinine, a small molecule that is both /uniFB01 ltered and secreted by the kidney. Low eGFR and high UACR levels are associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes, such as kidney failure and mortality. 1 4 -\n\nMetabolomics refers to the large-scale identi /uniFB01 cation and quanti /uniFB01 cation of metabolites in biological systems. This tool, to date primarily implemented in blood, has allowed for the discovery of circulating biomarkers associated with clinical outcomes, such as CKD. 5 8 -Given the kidney s role in ' /uniFB01 ltration, both serum and urine metabolomic investigations may inform the study of kidney diseases.\n\nDue to the number of contributing authors, the affiliations are listed at the end of this article.\n\nCorrespondence: Dr. Morgan E. Grams or Dr. Pascal Schlosser, email: Morgan.Grams@nyulangone.org or pascal.schlosser@uniklinik-freiburg.de\n\nReceived: February 16, 2024 Accepted: May 29, 2024 Published Online Ahead of Print: June 6, 2024\n\nIn addition to creatinine, other serum or urine-based metabolites may add information regarding kidney function, injury, or prognosis.\n\nA few previous kidney metabolomic studies have considered metabolites pro /uniFB01 led within serum and urine, but sample size or the metabolomic platform was limited or data restricted to blood levels. 9 14 -In this study, we aimed to identify non-drug serum and urine metabolites that were crosssectionally associated with eGFR or UACR, as well as metabolites that were longitudinally associated with a 40% decline in eGFR or UACR doubling in a large general population cohort. We assessed these associations using the same high-throughput metabolomics platform for 1255 and 1398 metabolites in serum and urine, respectively. We also aimed to assess whether including serum, urine, or both sets of metabolites with clinical variables can improve the performance of models predicting kidney function decline.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Study Population\n\nThe Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study is an ongoing study that began in 1987 that aims to investigate causes and clinical consequences of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases with respect to demographic characteristics. 15 The study recruited 15,792 participants aged between 45 and 64 years at enrollment (visit 1) from four communities (Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; Minneapolis suburbs, MN; and Washington County, MD).\n\nOur study population was drawn from the 6538 ARIC participants who attended visit 5 (2011 -2013). To be included in the current analyses, we required that participants had non-missing eGFRcr,cys ( n 5 101 excluded), were in either the White or Black race category ( n 5 18 excluded), had no prevalent kidney failure ( n 5 36 excluded), and had both serum and urine metabolite data available with at least 50% detectable endogenous metabolites (Supplemental Figure 1). This selection resulted in a study sample of 1612 participants used in cross-sectional analyses.\n\nFor the longitudinal analyses with a 40% decline in eGFR or UACR doubling, we required that participants had at least one follow-up visit at visit 6 (2016 -2017) or 7 (2018 -2019) with non-missing eGFR or UACR data. This resulted in 942 individuals in our study population for the decline in eGFR analysis and 894 individuals for the doubling in UACR analyses. ARIC conducted active surveillance and is linked to mortality and the United States Renal Data System registries.\n\nTo assess whether including serum, urine, or both sets of metabolites improved prediction of eGFR decline or UACR doubling beyond clinical variables, individuals common to both longitudinal study samples were included ( n 5 879).\n\nReplication of longitudinal analyses were conducted in the ongoing prospective German Chronic Kidney Disease (GCKD) study, which began in 2010 and enrolled 5217 adult individuals with CKD. 16 Inclusion criteria encompassed patients regularly visited by nephrologists, with an eGFR between 30 and 60 ml min 2 1 per 1.73 m 2 or an eGFR . 60 ml min 2 1 per 1.73 m 2 along with UACR . 300 mg per gram (or urinary protein-creatinine ratio . 500 mg per gram). The GCKD study was registered in the national clinical studies registry (DRKS 00003971) and received approval from the local ethics committees at participating institutions (universities or medical faculties of Aachen, Berlin, Erlangen, Freiburg, Hannover, Heidelberg, Jena, Munchen, and Wurzburg). \u0308 \u0308 All participants provided written informed consent.\n\n## Metabolomic Profiling and Preprocessing\n\nSerum and urine samples stored at 2 80\u00b0C were sent to Metabolon, Inc. (Durham, NC) for untargeted metabolite pro /uniFB01 ling by liquid chromatography -mass spectroscopy (serum pro /uniFB01 led in 2019, urine pro /uniFB01 led in 2022). A total of 1464 serum metabolites (including 320 unnamed and 302 drug metabolites) and 1581 urine metabolites (including 467 unnamed and 382 drug metabolites) were identi /uniFB01 ed and quanti /uniFB01 ed. Metabolites were categorized into ten superpathways by Metabolon, namely amino acid, carbohydrate, cofactors and vitamins, energy, lipid, nucleotide, partially characterized molecules, peptide, unknown, and xenobiotics. Drug metabolites were excluded from our analyses (serum: 302 metabolites, urine: 382 metabolites). The preprocessing steps for serum and urine data were conducted in parallel.\n\nFirst, for both serum and urine data, each metabolite was batch normalized to account for minor instrument variations between batches per manufacturer protocol (Metabolon, Inc.). Missing values were imputed with the minimum observed value for endogenous and unnamed metabolites present in more than 20% of samples.\n\nFor urine data only, we accounted for the varying dilutions between samples using probability quotient (PQ) normalization. 17 In the context of urine metabolomics, PQ normalization operates by /uniFB01 nding a most probable dilution factor estimated from a low-missingness subset of metabolites to normalize each sample. We estimated our PQ factors for normalization on the basis of all 372 endogenous metabolites with , 1% missing sample measurements. The PQ factors were computed with the nonimputed data of these metabolites and then used to normalize the samples for the imputed urine data. In Supplemental Figure 2, we provide a plot of the PQ factors against urinary creatinine, the reference that is used clinically. 18,19\n\nFor both serum and urine data, we then rescaled each metabolite to have a median of 1 and then log2 transformed the metabolites to reduce skewness. Metabolites with variance # 0.01 were removed, and endogenous and unnamed metabolites were winsorized at 5 SDs. Finally, we excluded any metabolites with . 80% missing sample measurements.\n\nThe /uniFB01 nal dataset consisted of 1255 serum metabolites and 1398 urine metabolites, with 721 metabolites detected in both bio /uniFB02 uids.\n\nGCKDmetabolomics were quanti /uniFB01 ed from stored EDTA plasma and spot urine. Preprocessing was conducted analogously, except for winsorization, which was not performed. 20 The /uniFB01 nal dataset for the selected plasma and urine metabolites consisted of 4744 individuals with complete data.\n\n## Covariates\n\nStudy center included four categories as mentioned earlier: Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; Minneapolis suburbs, MN;andWashington County, MD. Diabetes was de /uniFB01 ned as having a blood glucose level of $ 140 mg/dl after a fasting\n\nperiod of $ 8 hours or a nonfasting blood glucose level of $ 200 mg/dl, a self-reported clinical diagnosis of diabetes, or taking medications for diabetes or high blood glucose. Systolic BP was determined using the average of the second and third sitting BP measurements of three total measurements that were taken 5 minutes apart with no change in posture. Prevalent coronary heart disease was de /uniFB01 ned as having prevalent myocardial infarction from adjudicated electrocardiogram data in visit 5, diagnosed myocardial infarction, or a history of coronary bypass or angioplasty of a coronary artery/arteries. Age, sex, race, and smoking status (current smoker, former smoker, never smoked, or unknown) were self-reported. The use of hypertension medications was ascertained by inspection of medications taken in the previous 2 weeks. The race-free 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation 21 was used to calculate the eGFR for each visit using both serum creatinine and cystatin C. Creatinine was measured using the Roche enzymatic method, whereas cystatin C was measured by immunoturbidimetry. Urine albumin (used to calculate urine albumin-creatinine ratios [UACR], i.e ., albuminuria) at each visit was quanti /uniFB01 ed by immunoturbidimetry from random urine samples. Total cholesterol, weight, and height (the latter two used to de /uniFB01 ne body mass index) were measured during visit 5. GCKD used the 2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation based on serum creatinine. 22\n\n## Statistical Analysis\n\nBaseline characteristics of the study population were summarized using means and SDs or medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for skewed distributions and for continuous variables, respectively. Categorical variables were summarized with counts and proportions. To characterize the serum and urine metabolome on a descriptive level before integrating kidney function, metabolites were sorted by their superpathways and the Spearman correlations between all pairs of metabolites were calculated. The median correlations by superpathway were then calculated excluding paired serum -serum and urine -urine metabolites that have a correlation of 1. Summary statistics of the correlations by superpathways for paired serum -urine metabolites were separately reported.\n\nIn the cross-sectional analyses to investigate associations between metabolites within each bio /uniFB02 uid and eGFR or log2(UACR), sequentially adjusted multiple linear regression models were implemented: model 1 adjusted for demographics only, that is, age, sex, race, and study center; model 2 adjusted additionally for body mass index, systolic BP, diabetes, prevalent coronary heart disease, use of hypertension medications, smoking status, and total cholesterol; model 3 adjusted additionally for log2(UACR) when assessing associations with eGFR or eGFR when assessing associations with log2(UACR).\n\nTo assess whether speci /uniFB01 c superpathways were overrepresented among the metabolites that were associated with eGFR or UACR, a permutation test was performed by repeating the regression analyses over all metabolites for a total of 1000 times. 23 Metabolite levels were permuted en bloc to retain the same correlation structure. In other words, the data structure was retained, but eGFR (or UACR)\n\nwas permuted for a total of 1000 permutations. In each permutation, all metabolite regressions were performed. The number of signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites from the original analysis was used to identify the top associations from each permutation. A superpathway was determined to be over-represented if the original number of signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites in the superpathway was greater than the number of signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites in the same superpathway in more than 95% of the permutations ( P , 0.05).\n\nIn the longitudinal analyses to investigate associations between metabolites within each bio /uniFB02 uid and 40% eGFR decline or UACR doubling from visit 5 by visit 7 (mean follow-up time of 6.6 years), three sequentially adjusted logistic regression models were considered as before. Of note, model 3 adjusted for both baseline eGFR and log2(UACR) in both analyses.\n\nMultiple tests were accounted for using a Bonferronicorrected threshold to assess for statistical signi /uniFB01 cance. Signi /uniFB01 cant serum metabolites were de /uniFB01 ned to have P , 0.05/ 1255 5 4.0E-5, whereas signi /uniFB01 cant urine metabolites were de /uniFB01 ned to have P , 0.05/1397 5 3.6E-5.\n\nMetabolites found to be signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with kidney function or kidney function decline were reassessed with model 3 in individuals strati /uniFB01 ed by diabetes status, excluding the diabetes adjustment.\n\nTo investigate whether including both urine and serum metabolites in a logistic model for a 40% decline in eGFR or UACR doubling improved discrimination as compared with clinical covariates, we /uniFB01 rst de /uniFB01 ned a model using clinical covariates described in model 3 of the longitudinal analyses, assessing performance using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Then, we evaluated models with clinical covariates 1 the top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites only, clinical covariates 1 the top /uniFB01 ve urine metabolites only, and clinical covariates 1 the top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites and top /uniFB01 veurine metabolites. The top metabolites were selected from endogenous metabolites with the lowest P values from model 3 of the longitudinal analyses. Model improvement was assessed using the difference in AUC (DeLong test). 24 GCKDanalyses did not include race and center as covariates.\n\n## Results\n\n## Baseline Characteristics of Study Populations\n\nThe study population for the cross-sectional analyses included 1612 participants with a mean age of 76 years (SD 6); 56% were women, 49% were Black, mean eGFR was 62 ml/ min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 20), and median UACR was 13 mg/g (IQR, 25) (Table 1).\n\nFor longitudinal analyses with eGFR decline as the outcome, the study population with 942 participants had a mean age of 75 years (SD 5); 59% were female, 54% were Black, the mean eGFR was 65 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 20), and the median UACR was 10 mg/g (IQR, 18). The mean time between visits was 3.4 years, and 10% ( n 5 97) people developed a 40% decline in eGFR, whereas 33% ( n 5 294) people developed doubling of UACR.\n\n## Metabolite-Metabolite Correlations\n\nIntermetabolite correlation varied across superpathways (Figure 1A). Within superpathways, median correlations were\n\nTable 1.

Metabolites within the xenobiotic superpathway had the highest correlations between serum and urine (median, 0.79; IQR, 0.19) (Figure 2B), potentially indicating the primacy of renal excretion and limited endogenous metabolism for these compounds.\n\n## Cross-Sectional Associations between Serum or Urine Metabolites and Kidney Function\n\nThere were 675 and 542 serum and urine metabolites that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with eGFR (Figure 3, A and B), including 248 shared metabolites. A higher proportion of serum metabolites were inversely associated with eGFR compared with urine metabolites (71% for serum versus 56% for urine), representing accumulation of many metabolites in lower eGFR.\n\nTop metabolites that were higher with lower eGFR included creatinine ( b 52 0.014, P , 1.0E-323), hydroxyasparagine ( b 52 0.020, P , 1.0E-323), 2,3-dihydroxy-5methylthio-4-pentenoic acid ( b 52 0.020, P , 1.0E-323), C-glycosyltryptophan ( b 52 0.020, P , 1.5E-304), and pseudouridine ( b 52 0.018, P , 7.5E-294). All but pseudouridine were classi /uniFB01 ed into the amino acid superpathway. Amino acids and carbohydrates were overrepresented within the signi /uniFB01 cant serum metabolites (Figure 4A).\n\nBy contrast, top urine metabolites included those with negative associations with eGFR, 1-methylguanidine ( b 52 0.031, P 5 6.9E-202), asymmetric dimethylarginine ( b 5 0.013, P 5 5.3E-109), and X-12117 ( b 52 0.024, P 5 9.7E-102) and positive associations with eGFR, ribitol\n\n( b 5 0.014, P 5 5.8E-98), and guanine ( b 5 0.024, P 5 4.4E92). Amino acids and carbohydrates were also found to be over-represented within signi /uniFB01 cant urine metabolites (Figure 4B).\n\n## Cross-Sectional Associations between Serum or Urine Metabolites and Albuminuria\n\nThere were 75 serum and 91 urine metabolites that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with log2(UACR) (Figure 3, C and D), with seven signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites being shared between both bio /uniFB02 uids. For both bio /uniFB02 uids, the number of metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with log2(UACR) were fewer than the number of metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with eGFR. The top /uniFB01 ve signi /uniFB01 -cant serum metabolites cross-sectionally associated with log2(UACR) were 3,5-dichloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid ( b 52 0.15, P 5 2.0E-44); X-24951 ( b 52 0.21, P 5 9.0E-42); 3-bromo-5-chloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid ( b 52 0.13, P 5 2.1E-33); 4-hydroxychlorothalonil ( b 52 0.15, P 5 7.4E-30); and X-11372 ( b 52 0.12, P 5 6.3E-27), and all were negatively correlated with log2(UACR); each of these named metabolites were in the xenobiotic superpathway. Amino acids and carbohydrates were over-represented within signi /uniFB01 cant serum metabolites (Figure 4C).\n\nIn contrast to /uniFB01 ndings in serum, urine lipids were over-represented in metabolite associations with albuminuria (Figure 4D). The top /uniFB01 ve signi /uniFB01 cant urine metabolites included 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-glycerophosphatidylcholine (GPC) (16:0/20:4n6) ( b 5 0.35, P 5 3.2E-117), 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPC (16:0/18:2) ( b 5 0.39, P 5 5.7E-97), 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPC (18:0/18:2) ( b 5 0.39, P 5 2.5E-71), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylGPC (16:0/18:1) ( b 5 0.30, P 5 2.8E-43), and 1-stearoyl-2arachidonoyl-GPE (18:0/20:4) ( b 5 0.13, P 5 5.9E-25), all of which were lipids.\n\nFigure 1. Heat maps of the correlations and median correlations between every serum-urine metabolite pair, organized by superpathways. (A) Correlations between serum metabolites were more positive and generally stronger than correlations between urine metabolites or serum-urine metabolites. (B) Carbohydrates were most positively correlated with each other in serum (median correlation 0.2), urine (median correlation 0.06), and between biofluids (0.07). The strongest negative correlation was between serum carbohydrates and urine nucleotides (median correlation, 20.05). The superpathway abbreviations along the x axis and y axis are amino acid (AA), carbohydrate (Carb), cofactors and vitamins (Vit), energy (E), lipid (Lip), nucleotide (Nuc), partially characterized molecules (PCM), peptide (Pep), unknown (Un), and xenobiotics (Xen).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThere were /uniFB01 ve metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with both eGFR and log2(UACR) in both bio /uniFB02 uids: guanidinosuccinate; N2,N2-dimethylguanosine; hydroxyN6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine; X-13844; and X-25422 (see Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 for their associations). All /uniFB01 ve metabolites had negative associations with eGFR in both serum and urine. On the other hand, they were all positively associated with log2(UACR) in serum. In urine, guanidinosuccinate, X-13844, and X-25422 were positively associated with log2(UACR), whereas N2,N2dimethylguanosine and hydroxy-N6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine were negatively associated with log2(UACR).\n\n## Longitudinal Associations between Serum or Urine Metabolites and Kidney Function Decline\n\nNo serum or urine metabolite was signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with a 40% decline in eGFR at the Bonferroni-corrected threshold ( P for serum 5 4.0E-5, P for urine 5 3.6E-5) (Figure 5, A and B). Serum mannose (hazard ratio [HR] 5 2.3 [1.6 -3.2], P 5 2.7E-5) and urine X-12117 (HR 5 1.7 [1.3 -2.2], P 5 1.9E-5) were positively associated with UACR doubling, whereas urine sebacate (C10-DC) (HR 5 0.86 [0.80 -0.92], P 5 1.9E-5) was inversely associated with UACR doubling (Figure 5, C and D).\n\n## Evaluation of Effect Modification by Diabetes Status\n\nThe associations between metabolites and kidney function, albuminuria, and kidney function decline were comparable regardless of diabetes status (Supplemental Figure 3). On the other hand, several metabolites had higher or lower levels by diabetes status (Supplemental\n\nTable 3). Predictably, sugars and sugar compounds, such as glucose and mannonate, had elevated levels in serum and urine among individuals with diabetes. Several N -lactoyl amino acids previously found to be risk factors of diabetic retinopathy 25 were also elevated in both serum and urine for individuals with diabetes. Serum levels of choline-containing metabolites tended to be lower in participants with diabetes.\n\n## Benefit of Measuring Metabolites in Multiple Biofluids\n\nMetabolites that were detected in both serum and urine were more likely to be associated with eGFR than metabolites that were detected in only one of the bio /uniFB02 uids (84% metabolites detected in serum and urine were signi /uniFB01 cant versus 29% metabolites detected in serum only versus 31% metabolites detected in urine only, chisquared P 5 8.9E-114), indicating the centrality of metabolite excretion in kidney function (Figure 6). Similarly, for associations with albuminuria, more shared metabolites had signi /uniFB01 cant associations compared with those detected in a single bio /uniFB02 uid (16% versus 3% versus 4%, respectively, P 5 1.7E-20).

Including serum and urine metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly increased the AUC further to 0.87 ( P for difference in AUCs between the clinical model and the clinical 1 serum 1 urine metabolites model 5 8.1E-6).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites associated with UACR doubling were mannose, N -acetylglycine, oleoylcholine, arachidonoylcholine, and g -glutamylcitrulline, whereas the top /uniFB01 ve urine metabolites were sebacate (C10-DC), I-urobilinogen, N -acetylglutamine, N -acetylcitrulline, and tridecenedioate (C13:1-DC). Including serum and urine metabolites in a prediction model of albuminuria doubling increased the AUC from 0.66 (clinical covariates only) to 0.69 (serum metabolites 1 clinical covariates, P for difference in AUC from the clinical covariates only model 5 0.012) and 0.71 (urine metabolites 1 clinical covariates, P for difference in AUC from the clinical covariates only model 5 3.6E-4). Including both serum and urine metabolites increased the AUC to 0.73 ( P for difference in AUC from the clinical covariates -only model 5 2.9E-5). To test the conclusion in an external cohort of participants with CKD, we used the same metabolites quanti /uniFB01 ed in plasma and urine in the GCKD study. Addition of blood or urine metabolomics improved risk prediction in the patients with CKD, albeit to a modest degree. Supplemental Table 5 contains the full equations for each of the above models for longitudinal risk prediction, and Supplemental Table 6 shows the Spearman correlations between the metabolites included in the models.\n\nThis large community-based study identi /uniFB01 es metabolomic correlates and antecedents of kidney parameters and kidney function decline, respectively, and suggests the utility of measuring metabolites in more than one bio /uniFB02 uid. Kidney function had a profound effect on both the circulating metabolome and the urinary metabolome. In addition, novel circulating and urinary metabolites were identi /uniFB01 ed that preceded the decline of kidney function more than 5 years in advance. Moreover, the results suggest that measurement of metabolites from multiple bio /uniFB02 uids can provide distinct and orthogonal insight into kidney disease biology and prognosis.\n\nMost prior metabolomics studies of kidney function have focused on blood metabolites and eGFR. 14,26,27 For example, a previous study discovered 65 circulating metabolites associated with eGFRcr. 14 Of the 65 metabolites, 49 were measured in our study and all displayed signi /uniFB01 cant associations with eGFRcr-cys ( P , 0.05/49), providing face validity. Similarly, several of the top serum metabolites are known markers of /uniFB01 ltration: creatinine, pseudouridine, and C-glycosyltryptophan. 28,29 Other /uniFB01 ndings expand upon the existing literature: Serum guanidinosuccinate, previously associated with kidney failure, was negatively associated with eGFR and positively associated with albuminuria. 30,31 Serum N2,N2dimethylguanosine, a modi /uniFB01 ed ribonucleoside known to be elevated in kidney failure, was associated with worse kidney function and albuminuria doubling. 32 We also found that higher levels of choline and its derivatives, such as trimethylamine N -oxide, were risk factors of kidney function or kidney function decline, although the latter associations were NS at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold. This association is consistent with various studies that have identi /uniFB01 ed choline and its derivatives as markers of renal metabolism 33 that are upregulated in AKI. 34\n\nFigure 3.

Many of the known uremic toxins, or metabolites that accumulate in serum in the setting of low eGFR ( e.g ., urea, indoxyl sulfate, kynurenines), also had negative associations with eGFR in urine. This suggests that for these metabolites, absolute levels of excretion are higher in lower eGFR, albeit insuf /uniFB01 cient to maintain a normal nonelevated level in blood. Notably, higher levels of metabolites in blood could re /uniFB02 ect retention or systemic overproduction. 35\n\nEight of the ten metabolite superpathways were overrepresented in at least one of the four cross-sectional analyses for serum or urine metabolite associations with eGFR or albuminuria. Among the metabolites associated with albuminuria, urinary lipids were over-represented. Several\n\nFigure 4.

Phosphatidylcholines are essential components of biological membranes and critical for LDL and chylomicron assembly. GPCs are also osmolytes that accumulate under hypertonic stress, which can occur in the setting of low kidney function, leading to increased levels of excretion into urine. Their increased presence in urine in the setting of albuminuria may represent damaged cell membranes or coupling with urine albumin because albumin has a high af /uniFB01 nity for lipids. 36 38 -High levels of lipids may also indicate dyslipidemia or abnormal lipid metabolism, which may cause or accelerate lipotoxicity-mediated atherosclerotic renal vascular damage, leading to albuminuria. 39 42 -\n\nMany of the metabolites detected in both serum and urine were associated with eGFR and albuminuria, which may be a direct re /uniFB02 ection of the kidney s role in ' /uniFB01 ltration. The metabolites with highest correlation between serum and urine levels were xenobiotics. Interestingly, most\n\nUrine metabolites\n\nFigure 5.

This may re /uniFB02 ect the fact that urine levels are determined not only by /uniFB01 ltration but also by tubular secretion. Although GFR associates with the secretory clearance of drugs, 43 the relationship can be nonlinear for speci /uniFB01 c solutes, especially in advanced CKD. 44 More likely, however, is that blood levels of intravascular hydration are extraordinarily well regulated, whereas urine has a wide range of dilution that statistical methods ( e.g ., PQ normalization) can only partially address.\n\nIn longitudinal analyses, higher serum mannose and lower urine sebacate was a strong risk factor of increasing albuminuria, quanti /uniFB01 ed by UACR doubling. Previous kidney metabolomic studies have reported positive associations between serum mannose with kidney failure 45\n\nFigure 6.

Urine sebacate is a naturally occurring urine acid, and dibutyl sebacate is a common plasticizer used in the coating of sustained-release drug tablets. 47 -51 Thus, higher levels of urinary sebacate may re /uniFB02 ect use of speci /uniFB01 c medications.\n\nAlthough the aim of this work was not focused on prediction of CKD progression, simple logistic models including either serum metabolites or urine metabolites improved discrimination over a model of clinical covariates only, and the model including both serum and urine metabolites had the best discrimination among all models considered. This /uniFB01 nding was replicated in patients with CKD in the GCKD cohort. Although these /uniFB01 ndings require validation in independent studies, they lend credence to the idea that not only do both bio /uniFB02 uids provide key information in estimating kidney prognosis but also the information they provide is complementary.\n\nThis study re /uniFB02 ects one of the largest to date to use both serum and urine metabolites in the cross-sectional and longitudinal assessment of kidney function. Serum and urine metabolites were identi /uniFB01 ed using the same metabolomics platform and encompassed over 700 shared metabolites. However, there are several limitations of our study. Our analyses used covariates that were selfreported (hypertension medication, smoking). Because our study cohort included participants with an average baseline age of 76 years, average eGFR of above 60 ml/min per 1.73 m , as well as Black and White indi2 viduals only, our results may not be generalizable to younger populations, populations with higher prevalence of kidney disease, or other racial/ethnic groups. Because the liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy quanti -/uniFB01 -cation was relative, not absolute, we did not assess for associations between the fractional excretion of metabolites and kidney function or kidney function decline. Confounders may be measured incompletely and with error, and there may be additional confounders that were not included. For example, analyses of the effect of diet and fasting status on our /uniFB01 ndings were not conducted; previous studies in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension-Sodium trial have suggested that there may be differences in in /uniFB02 uential serum and urine biomarkers by dietary patterns. 52,53 The multimetabolite model of kidney function decline was designed to investigate the potential utility of including metabolites from both urine and serum; if optimal discrimination were the aim, performance might be further improved with a method, such as elastic net regression, that includes criteria for intermetabolite correlations. ARIC is a general population cohort of older participants, whereas GCKD consists of individuals diagnosed with CKD; the differences in the sample characteristics between the ARIC and GCKD cohorts may in /uniFB02 uence the validity of our replication.\n\nIn summary, we provide a comprehensive atlas of serum and urine metabolite associations with eGFR and albuminuria cross-sectionally and longitudinally in a large\n\n## Table 2.

All analyses were adjusted for clinical and demographic covariates, including for baseline eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) in longitudinal analyses.\n\nResults At visit 5 of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, the mean age of participants was 76 years (SD 6); 56% were women, mean eGFR was 62 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 20), and median UACR level was 13 mg/g (interquartile range, 25). In cross-sectional analysis, 675 serum and 542 urine metabolites were associated with eGFR (Bonferroni-corrected P , 4.0E-5 for serum analyses and P , 3.6E-5 for urine analyses), including 248 metabolites shared across bio /uniFB02 uids. Fewer metabolites (75 serum and 91 urine metabolites, including seven metabolites shared across bio /uniFB02 uids) were cross-sectionally associated with albuminuria. Guanidinosuccinate; N2,N2-dimethylguanosine; hydroxy-N6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine; X-13844; and X-25422 were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with both eGFR and albuminuria. Over a mean follow-up of 6.6 years, serum mannose (hazard ratio [HR], 2.3 [1.6 -3.2], P 5 2.7E-5) and urine X-12117 (HR, 1.7 [1.3 -2.2], P 5 1.9E-5) were risk factors of UACR doubling, whereas urine sebacate (HR, 0.86 [0.80 -0.92], P 5 1.9E-5) was inversely associated. Compared with clinical characteristics alone, including the top /uniFB01 ve endogenous metabolites in serum and urine associated with longitudinal outcomes improved the outcome prediction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for eGFR decline: clinical model 5 0.79, clinical 1 metabolites model 5 0.87, P 5 8.1E-6; for UACR doubling: clinical model 5 0.66, clinical 1 metabolites model 5 0.73, P 5 2.9E-5).\n\nConclusions Metabolomic pro /uniFB01 ling in different bio /uniFB02 uids provided distinct and potentially complementary insights into the biology and prognosis of kidney diseases.\n\nJASN 35: 1252 -1265, 2024. doi: https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.0000000000000403\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe kidney is an organ that interfaces between blood and urine, and its function is quanti /uniFB01 ed by the accumulation and /uniFB02 ow of small molecules or metabolites across bio /uniFB02 uids. eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) are two metrics commonly used to quantify kidney function and injury, with both metrics incorporating creatinine, a small molecule that is both /uniFB01 ltered and secreted by the kidney. Low eGFR and high UACR levels are associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes, such as kidney failure and mortality. 1 4 -\n\nMetabolomics refers to the large-scale identi /uniFB01 cation and quanti /uniFB01 cation of metabolites in biological systems. This tool, to date primarily implemented in blood, has allowed for the discovery of circulating biomarkers associated with clinical outcomes, such as CKD. 5 8 -Given the kidney s role in ' /uniFB01 ltration, both serum and urine metabolomic investigations may inform the study of kidney diseases.\n\nDue to the number of contributing authors, the affiliations are listed at the end of this article.\n\nCorrespondence: Dr. Morgan E. Grams or Dr. Pascal Schlosser, email: Morgan.Grams@nyulangone.org or pascal.schlosser@uniklinik-freiburg.de\n\nReceived: February 16, 2024 Accepted: May 29, 2024 Published Online Ahead of Print: June 6, 2024\n\nIn addition to creatinine, other serum or urine-based metabolites may add information regarding kidney function, injury, or prognosis.\n\nA few previous kidney metabolomic studies have considered metabolites pro /uniFB01 led within serum and urine, but sample size or the metabolomic platform was limited or data restricted to blood levels. 9 14 -In this study, we aimed to identify non-drug serum and urine metabolites that were crosssectionally associated with eGFR or UACR, as well as metabolites that were longitudinally associated with a 40% decline in eGFR or UACR doubling in a large general population cohort. We assessed these associations using the same high-throughput metabolomics platform for 1255 and 1398 metabolites in serum and urine, respectively. We also aimed to assess whether including serum, urine, or both sets of metabolites with clinical variables can improve the performance of models predicting kidney function decline.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Study Population\n\nThe Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study is an ongoing study that began in 1987 that aims to investigate causes and clinical consequences of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases with respect to demographic characteristics. 15 The study recruited 15,792 participants aged between 45 and 64 years at enrollment (visit 1) from four communities (Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; Minneapolis suburbs, MN; and Washington County, MD).\n\nOur study population was drawn from the 6538 ARIC participants who attended visit 5 (2011 -2013). To be included in the current analyses, we required that participants had non-missing eGFRcr,cys ( n 5 101 excluded), were in either the White or Black race category ( n 5 18 excluded), had no prevalent kidney failure ( n 5 36 excluded), and had both serum and urine metabolite data available with at least 50% detectable endogenous metabolites (Supplemental Figure 1). This selection resulted in a study sample of 1612 participants used in cross-sectional analyses.\n\nFor the longitudinal analyses with a 40% decline in eGFR or UACR doubling, we required that participants had at least one follow-up visit at visit 6 (2016 -2017) or 7 (2018 -2019) with non-missing eGFR or UACR data. This resulted in 942 individuals in our study population for the decline in eGFR analysis and 894 individuals for the doubling in UACR analyses. ARIC conducted active surveillance and is linked to mortality and the United States Renal Data System registries.\n\nTo assess whether including serum, urine, or both sets of metabolites improved prediction of eGFR decline or UACR doubling beyond clinical variables, individuals common to both longitudinal study samples were included ( n 5 879).\n\nReplication of longitudinal analyses were conducted in the ongoing prospective German Chronic Kidney Disease (GCKD) study, which began in 2010 and enrolled 5217 adult individuals with CKD. 16 Inclusion criteria encompassed patients regularly visited by nephrologists, with an eGFR between 30 and 60 ml min 2 1 per 1.73 m 2 or an eGFR . 60 ml min 2 1 per 1.73 m 2 along with UACR . 300 mg per gram (or urinary protein-creatinine ratio . 500 mg per gram). The GCKD study was registered in the national clinical studies registry (DRKS 00003971) and received approval from the local ethics committees at participating institutions (universities or medical faculties of Aachen, Berlin, Erlangen, Freiburg, Hannover, Heidelberg, Jena, Munchen, and Wurzburg). \u0308 \u0308 All participants provided written informed consent.\n\n## Metabolomic Profiling and Preprocessing\n\nSerum and urine samples stored at 2 80\u00b0C were sent to Metabolon, Inc. (Durham, NC) for untargeted metabolite pro /uniFB01 ling by liquid chromatography -mass spectroscopy (serum pro /uniFB01 led in 2019, urine pro /uniFB01 led in 2022). A total of 1464 serum metabolites (including 320 unnamed and 302 drug metabolites) and 1581 urine metabolites (including 467 unnamed and 382 drug metabolites) were identi /uniFB01 ed and quanti /uniFB01 ed. Metabolites were categorized into ten superpathways by Metabolon, namely amino acid, carbohydrate, cofactors and vitamins, energy, lipid, nucleotide, partially characterized molecules, peptide, unknown, and xenobiotics. Drug metabolites were excluded from our analyses (serum: 302 metabolites, urine: 382 metabolites). The preprocessing steps for serum and urine data were conducted in parallel.\n\nFirst, for both serum and urine data, each metabolite was batch normalized to account for minor instrument variations between batches per manufacturer protocol (Metabolon, Inc.). Missing values were imputed with the minimum observed value for endogenous and unnamed metabolites present in more than 20% of samples.\n\nFor urine data only, we accounted for the varying dilutions between samples using probability quotient (PQ) normalization. 17 In the context of urine metabolomics, PQ normalization operates by /uniFB01 nding a most probable dilution factor estimated from a low-missingness subset of metabolites to normalize each sample. We estimated our PQ factors for normalization on the basis of all 372 endogenous metabolites with , 1% missing sample measurements. The PQ factors were computed with the nonimputed data of these metabolites and then used to normalize the samples for the imputed urine data. In Supplemental Figure 2, we provide a plot of the PQ factors against urinary creatinine, the reference that is used clinically. 18,19\n\nFor both serum and urine data, we then rescaled each metabolite to have a median of 1 and then log2 transformed the metabolites to reduce skewness. Metabolites with variance # 0.01 were removed, and endogenous and unnamed metabolites were winsorized at 5 SDs. Finally, we excluded any metabolites with . 80% missing sample measurements.\n\nThe /uniFB01 nal dataset consisted of 1255 serum metabolites and 1398 urine metabolites, with 721 metabolites detected in both bio /uniFB02 uids.\n\nGCKDmetabolomics were quanti /uniFB01 ed from stored EDTA plasma and spot urine. Preprocessing was conducted analogously, except for winsorization, which was not performed. 20 The /uniFB01 nal dataset for the selected plasma and urine metabolites consisted of 4744 individuals with complete data.\n\n## Covariates\n\nStudy center included four categories as mentioned earlier: Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; Minneapolis suburbs, MN;andWashington County, MD. Diabetes was de /uniFB01 ned as having a blood glucose level of $ 140 mg/dl after a fasting\n\nperiod of $ 8 hours or a nonfasting blood glucose level of $ 200 mg/dl, a self-reported clinical diagnosis of diabetes, or taking medications for diabetes or high blood glucose. Systolic BP was determined using the average of the second and third sitting BP measurements of three total measurements that were taken 5 minutes apart with no change in posture. Prevalent coronary heart disease was de /uniFB01 ned as having prevalent myocardial infarction from adjudicated electrocardiogram data in visit 5, diagnosed myocardial infarction, or a history of coronary bypass or angioplasty of a coronary artery/arteries. Age, sex, race, and smoking status (current smoker, former smoker, never smoked, or unknown) were self-reported. The use of hypertension medications was ascertained by inspection of medications taken in the previous 2 weeks. The race-free 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation 21 was used to calculate the eGFR for each visit using both serum creatinine and cystatin C. Creatinine was measured using the Roche enzymatic method, whereas cystatin C was measured by immunoturbidimetry. Urine albumin (used to calculate urine albumin-creatinine ratios [UACR], i.e ., albuminuria) at each visit was quanti /uniFB01 ed by immunoturbidimetry from random urine samples. Total cholesterol, weight, and height (the latter two used to de /uniFB01 ne body mass index) were measured during visit 5. GCKD used the 2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation based on serum creatinine. 22\n\n## Statistical Analysis\n\nBaseline characteristics of the study population were summarized using means and SDs or medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for skewed distributions and for continuous variables, respectively. Categorical variables were summarized with counts and proportions. To characterize the serum and urine metabolome on a descriptive level before integrating kidney function, metabolites were sorted by their superpathways and the Spearman correlations between all pairs of metabolites were calculated. The median correlations by superpathway were then calculated excluding paired serum -serum and urine -urine metabolites that have a correlation of 1. Summary statistics of the correlations by superpathways for paired serum -urine metabolites were separately reported.\n\nIn the cross-sectional analyses to investigate associations between metabolites within each bio /uniFB02 uid and eGFR or log2(UACR), sequentially adjusted multiple linear regression models were implemented: model 1 adjusted for demographics only, that is, age, sex, race, and study center; model 2 adjusted additionally for body mass index, systolic BP, diabetes, prevalent coronary heart disease, use of hypertension medications, smoking status, and total cholesterol; model 3 adjusted additionally for log2(UACR) when assessing associations with eGFR or eGFR when assessing associations with log2(UACR).\n\nTo assess whether speci /uniFB01 c superpathways were overrepresented among the metabolites that were associated with eGFR or UACR, a permutation test was performed by repeating the regression analyses over all metabolites for a total of 1000 times. 23 Metabolite levels were permuted en bloc to retain the same correlation structure. In other words, the data structure was retained, but eGFR (or UACR)\n\nwas permuted for a total of 1000 permutations. In each permutation, all metabolite regressions were performed. The number of signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites from the original analysis was used to identify the top associations from each permutation. A superpathway was determined to be over-represented if the original number of signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites in the superpathway was greater than the number of signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites in the same superpathway in more than 95% of the permutations ( P , 0.05).\n\nIn the longitudinal analyses to investigate associations between metabolites within each bio /uniFB02 uid and 40% eGFR decline or UACR doubling from visit 5 by visit 7 (mean follow-up time of 6.6 years), three sequentially adjusted logistic regression models were considered as before. Of note, model 3 adjusted for both baseline eGFR and log2(UACR) in both analyses.\n\nMultiple tests were accounted for using a Bonferronicorrected threshold to assess for statistical signi /uniFB01 cance. Signi /uniFB01 cant serum metabolites were de /uniFB01 ned to have P , 0.05/ 1255 5 4.0E-5, whereas signi /uniFB01 cant urine metabolites were de /uniFB01 ned to have P , 0.05/1397 5 3.6E-5.\n\nMetabolites found to be signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with kidney function or kidney function decline were reassessed with model 3 in individuals strati /uniFB01 ed by diabetes status, excluding the diabetes adjustment.\n\nTo investigate whether including both urine and serum metabolites in a logistic model for a 40% decline in eGFR or UACR doubling improved discrimination as compared with clinical covariates, we /uniFB01 rst de /uniFB01 ned a model using clinical covariates described in model 3 of the longitudinal analyses, assessing performance using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Then, we evaluated models with clinical covariates 1 the top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites only, clinical covariates 1 the top /uniFB01 ve urine metabolites only, and clinical covariates 1 the top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites and top /uniFB01 veurine metabolites. The top metabolites were selected from endogenous metabolites with the lowest P values from model 3 of the longitudinal analyses. Model improvement was assessed using the difference in AUC (DeLong test). 24 GCKDanalyses did not include race and center as covariates.\n\n## Results\n\n## Baseline Characteristics of Study Populations\n\nThe study population for the cross-sectional analyses included 1612 participants with a mean age of 76 years (SD 6); 56% were women, 49% were Black, mean eGFR was 62 ml/ min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 20), and median UACR was 13 mg/g (IQR, 25) (Table 1).\n\nFor longitudinal analyses with eGFR decline as the outcome, the study population with 942 participants had a mean age of 75 years (SD 5); 59% were female, 54% were Black, the mean eGFR was 65 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 20), and the median UACR was 10 mg/g (IQR, 18). The mean time between visits was 3.4 years, and 10% ( n 5 97) people developed a 40% decline in eGFR, whereas 33% ( n 5 294) people developed doubling of UACR.\n\n## Metabolite-Metabolite Correlations\n\nIntermetabolite correlation varied across superpathways (Figure 1A).

Metabolites within the xenobiotic superpathway had the highest correlations between serum and urine (median, 0.79; IQR, 0.19) (Figure 2B), potentially indicating the primacy of renal excretion and limited endogenous metabolism for these compounds.\n\n## Cross-Sectional Associations between Serum or Urine Metabolites and Kidney Function\n\nThere were 675 and 542 serum and urine metabolites that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with eGFR (Figure 3, A and B), including 248 shared metabolites. A higher proportion of serum metabolites were inversely associated with eGFR compared with urine metabolites (71% for serum versus 56% for urine), representing accumulation of many metabolites in lower eGFR.\n\nTop metabolites that were higher with lower eGFR included creatinine ( b 52 0.014, P , 1.0E-323), hydroxyasparagine ( b 52 0.020, P , 1.0E-323), 2,3-dihydroxy-5methylthio-4-pentenoic acid ( b 52 0.020, P , 1.0E-323), C-glycosyltryptophan ( b 52 0.020, P , 1.5E-304), and pseudouridine ( b 52 0.018, P , 7.5E-294). All but pseudouridine were classi /uniFB01 ed into the amino acid superpathway. Amino acids and carbohydrates were overrepresented within the signi /uniFB01 cant serum metabolites (Figure 4A).\n\nBy contrast, top urine metabolites included those with negative associations with eGFR, 1-methylguanidine ( b 52 0.031, P 5 6.9E-202), asymmetric dimethylarginine ( b 5 0.013, P 5 5.3E-109), and X-12117 ( b 52 0.024, P 5 9.7E-102) and positive associations with eGFR, ribitol\n\n( b 5 0.014, P 5 5.8E-98), and guanine ( b 5 0.024, P 5 4.4E92). Amino acids and carbohydrates were also found to be over-represented within signi /uniFB01 cant urine metabolites (Figure 4B).\n\n## Cross-Sectional Associations between Serum or Urine Metabolites and Albuminuria\n\nThere were 75 serum and 91 urine metabolites that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with log2(UACR) (Figure 3, C and D), with seven signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites being shared between both bio /uniFB02 uids. For both bio /uniFB02 uids, the number of metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with log2(UACR) were fewer than the number of metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with eGFR. The top /uniFB01 ve signi /uniFB01 -cant serum metabolites cross-sectionally associated with log2(UACR) were 3,5-dichloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid ( b 52 0.15, P 5 2.0E-44); X-24951 ( b 52 0.21, P 5 9.0E-42); 3-bromo-5-chloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid ( b 52 0.13, P 5 2.1E-33); 4-hydroxychlorothalonil ( b 52 0.15, P 5 7.4E-30); and X-11372 ( b 52 0.12, P 5 6.3E-27), and all were negatively correlated with log2(UACR); each of these named metabolites were in the xenobiotic superpathway. Amino acids and carbohydrates were over-represented within signi /uniFB01 cant serum metabolites (Figure 4C).\n\nIn contrast to /uniFB01 ndings in serum, urine lipids were over-represented in metabolite associations with albuminuria (Figure 4D). The top /uniFB01 ve signi /uniFB01 cant urine metabolites included 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-glycerophosphatidylcholine (GPC) (16:0/20:4n6) ( b 5 0.35, P 5 3.2E-117), 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPC (16:0/18:2) ( b 5 0.39, P 5 5.7E-97), 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPC (18:0/18:2) ( b 5 0.39, P 5 2.5E-71), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylGPC (16:0/18:1) ( b 5 0.30, P 5 2.8E-43), and 1-stearoyl-2arachidonoyl-GPE (18:0/20:4) ( b 5 0.13, P 5 5.9E-25), all of which were lipids.\n\nFigure 1. Heat maps of the correlations and median correlations between every serum-urine metabolite pair, organized by superpathways. (A) Correlations between serum metabolites were more positive and generally stronger than correlations between urine metabolites or serum-urine metabolites. (B) Carbohydrates were most positively correlated with each other in serum (median correlation 0.2), urine (median correlation 0.06), and between biofluids (0.07). The strongest negative correlation was between serum carbohydrates and urine nucleotides (median correlation, 20.05). The superpathway abbreviations along the x axis and y axis are amino acid (AA), carbohydrate (Carb), cofactors and vitamins (Vit), energy (E), lipid (Lip), nucleotide (Nuc), partially characterized molecules (PCM), peptide (Pep), unknown (Un), and xenobiotics (Xen).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThere were /uniFB01 ve metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with both eGFR and log2(UACR) in both bio /uniFB02 uids: guanidinosuccinate; N2,N2-dimethylguanosine; hydroxyN6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine; X-13844; and X-25422 (see Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 for their associations). All /uniFB01 ve metabolites had negative associations with eGFR in both serum and urine. On the other hand, they were all positively associated with log2(UACR) in serum. In urine, guanidinosuccinate, X-13844, and X-25422 were positively associated with log2(UACR), whereas N2,N2dimethylguanosine and hydroxy-N6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine were negatively associated with log2(UACR).\n\n## Longitudinal Associations between Serum or Urine Metabolites and Kidney Function Decline\n\nNo serum or urine metabolite was signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with a 40% decline in eGFR at the Bonferroni-corrected threshold ( P for serum 5 4.0E-5, P for urine 5 3.6E-5) (Figure 5, A and B). Serum mannose (hazard ratio [HR] 5 2.3 [1.6 -3.2], P 5 2.7E-5) and urine X-12117 (HR 5 1.7 [1.3 -2.2], P 5 1.9E-5) were positively associated with UACR doubling, whereas urine sebacate (C10-DC) (HR 5 0.86 [0.80 -0.92], P 5 1.9E-5) was inversely associated with UACR doubling (Figure 5, C and D).\n\n## Evaluation of Effect Modification by Diabetes Status\n\nThe associations between metabolites and kidney function, albuminuria, and kidney function decline were comparable regardless of diabetes status (Supplemental Figure 3). On the other hand, several metabolites had higher or lower levels by diabetes status (Supplemental\n\nTable 3). Predictably, sugars and sugar compounds, such as glucose and mannonate, had elevated levels in serum and urine among individuals with diabetes. Several N -lactoyl amino acids previously found to be risk factors of diabetic retinopathy 25 were also elevated in both serum and urine for individuals with diabetes. Serum levels of choline-containing metabolites tended to be lower in participants with diabetes.\n\n## Benefit of Measuring Metabolites in Multiple Biofluids\n\nMetabolites that were detected in both serum and urine were more likely to be associated with eGFR than metabolites that were detected in only one of the bio /uniFB02 uids (84% metabolites detected in serum and urine were signi /uniFB01 cant versus 29% metabolites detected in serum only versus 31% metabolites detected in urine only, chisquared P 5 8.9E-114), indicating the centrality of metabolite excretion in kidney function (Figure 6). Similarly, for associations with albuminuria, more shared metabolites had signi /uniFB01 cant associations compared with those detected in a single bio /uniFB02 uid (16% versus 3% versus 4%, respectively, P 5 1.7E-20). A list of the metabolites that were detected in serum only, urine only, or both serum and urine is presented in Supplemental Table 4.\n\nThe top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites associated with a 40% decline in eGFR were 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG); cysteine s-sulfate; 10-undecenoate (11:1n1); erythronate; and 1-ribosyl-imidazoleacetate, whereas the top /uniFB01 ve urine metabolites were choline; 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate; N -acetylarginine; glycerophosphoethanolamine; and glucuronide of C10H18O2 (2).

Including serum and urine metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly increased the AUC further to 0.87 ( P for difference in AUCs between the clinical model and the clinical 1 serum 1 urine metabolites model 5 8.1E-6).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites associated with UACR doubling were mannose, N -acetylglycine, oleoylcholine, arachidonoylcholine, and g -glutamylcitrulline, whereas the top /uniFB01 ve urine metabolites were sebacate (C10-DC), I-urobilinogen, N -acetylglutamine, N -acetylcitrulline, and tridecenedioate (C13:1-DC). Including serum and urine metabolites in a prediction model of albuminuria doubling increased the AUC from 0.66 (clinical covariates only) to 0.69 (serum metabolites 1 clinical covariates, P for difference in AUC from the clinical covariates only model 5 0.012) and 0.71 (urine metabolites 1 clinical covariates, P for difference in AUC from the clinical covariates only model 5 3.6E-4). Including both serum and urine metabolites increased the AUC to 0.73 ( P for difference in AUC from the clinical covariates -only model 5 2.9E-5). To test the conclusion in an external cohort of participants with CKD, we used the same metabolites quanti /uniFB01 ed in plasma and urine in the GCKD study. Addition of blood or urine metabolomics improved risk prediction in the patients with CKD, albeit to a modest degree. Supplemental Table 5 contains the full equations for each of the above models for longitudinal risk prediction, and Supplemental Table 6 shows the Spearman correlations between the metabolites included in the models.\n\nThis large community-based study identi /uniFB01 es metabolomic correlates and antecedents of kidney parameters and kidney function decline, respectively, and suggests the utility of measuring metabolites in more than one bio /uniFB02 uid. Kidney function had a profound effect on both the circulating metabolome and the urinary metabolome. In addition, novel circulating and urinary metabolites were identi /uniFB01 ed that preceded the decline of kidney function more than 5 years in advance. Moreover, the results suggest that measurement of metabolites from multiple bio /uniFB02 uids can provide distinct and orthogonal insight into kidney disease biology and prognosis.\n\nMost prior metabolomics studies of kidney function have focused on blood metabolites and eGFR. 14,26,27 For example, a previous study discovered 65 circulating metabolites associated with eGFRcr. 14 Of the 65 metabolites, 49 were measured in our study and all displayed signi /uniFB01 cant associations with eGFRcr-cys ( P , 0.05/49), providing face validity. Similarly, several of the top serum metabolites are known markers of /uniFB01 ltration: creatinine, pseudouridine, and C-glycosyltryptophan. 28,29 Other /uniFB01 ndings expand upon the existing literature: Serum guanidinosuccinate, previously associated with kidney failure, was negatively associated with eGFR and positively associated with albuminuria. 30,31 Serum N2,N2dimethylguanosine, a modi /uniFB01 ed ribonucleoside known to be elevated in kidney failure, was associated with worse kidney function and albuminuria doubling. 32 We also found that higher levels of choline and its derivatives, such as trimethylamine N -oxide, were risk factors of kidney function or kidney function decline, although the latter associations were NS at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold. This association is consistent with various studies that have identi /uniFB01 ed choline and its derivatives as markers of renal metabolism 33 that are upregulated in AKI. 34\n\nFigure 3.

Many of the known uremic toxins, or metabolites that accumulate in serum in the setting of low eGFR ( e.g ., urea, indoxyl sulfate, kynurenines), also had negative associations with eGFR in urine. This suggests that for these metabolites, absolute levels of excretion are higher in lower eGFR, albeit insuf /uniFB01 cient to maintain a normal nonelevated level in blood. Notably, higher levels of metabolites in blood could re /uniFB02 ect retention or systemic overproduction. 35\n\nEight of the ten metabolite superpathways were overrepresented in at least one of the four cross-sectional analyses for serum or urine metabolite associations with eGFR or albuminuria. Among the metabolites associated with albuminuria, urinary lipids were over-represented. Several\n\nFigure 4.

The plots correspond to the cross-sectional associations between (A) serum metabolites and eGFR, (B) urine metabolites and eGFR, (C) serum metabolites and albuminuria, and (D) urine metabolites and albuminuria. The darker shaded portion of each superpathway bar represents the proportion of significant metabolites. The top percentage given above each bar is the proportion of metabolites in the superpathway within all metabolites, whereas the bottom percentage is the proportion of significant metabolites in the superpathway within all significant metabolites (not within each superpathway or within all metabolites). Asterisks represent over-represented superpathways ( P , 0.05).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrelatively large GPC molecules had strong positive associations with albuminuria. Phosphatidylcholines are essential components of biological membranes and critical for LDL and chylomicron assembly. GPCs are also osmolytes that accumulate under hypertonic stress, which can occur in the setting of low kidney function, leading to increased levels of excretion into urine. Their increased presence in urine in the setting of albuminuria may represent damaged cell membranes or coupling with urine albumin because albumin has a high af /uniFB01 nity for lipids. 36 38 -High levels of lipids may also indicate dyslipidemia or abnormal lipid metabolism, which may cause or accelerate lipotoxicity-mediated atherosclerotic renal vascular damage, leading to albuminuria. 39 42 -\n\nMany of the metabolites detected in both serum and urine were associated with eGFR and albuminuria, which may be a direct re /uniFB02 ection of the kidney s role in ' /uniFB01 ltration. The metabolites with highest correlation between serum and urine levels were xenobiotics. Interestingly, most\n\nUrine metabolites\n\nFigure 5.

This may re /uniFB02 ect the fact that urine levels are determined not only by /uniFB01 ltration but also by tubular secretion. Although GFR associates with the secretory clearance of drugs, 43 the relationship can be nonlinear for speci /uniFB01 c solutes, especially in advanced CKD. 44 More likely, however, is that blood levels of intravascular hydration are extraordinarily well regulated, whereas urine has a wide range of dilution that statistical methods ( e.g ., PQ normalization) can only partially address.\n\nIn longitudinal analyses, higher serum mannose and lower urine sebacate was a strong risk factor of increasing albuminuria, quanti /uniFB01 ed by UACR doubling. Previous kidney metabolomic studies have reported positive associations between serum mannose with kidney failure 45\n\nFigure 6.

Urine sebacate is a naturally occurring urine acid, and dibutyl sebacate is a common plasticizer used in the coating of sustained-release drug tablets. 47 -51 Thus, higher levels of urinary sebacate may re /uniFB02 ect use of speci /uniFB01 c medications.\n\nAlthough the aim of this work was not focused on prediction of CKD progression, simple logistic models including either serum metabolites or urine metabolites improved discrimination over a model of clinical covariates only, and the model including both serum and urine metabolites had the best discrimination among all models considered. This /uniFB01 nding was replicated in patients with CKD in the GCKD cohort. Although these /uniFB01 ndings require validation in independent studies, they lend credence to the idea that not only do both bio /uniFB02 uids provide key information in estimating kidney prognosis but also the information they provide is complementary.\n\nThis study re /uniFB02 ects one of the largest to date to use both serum and urine metabolites in the cross-sectional and longitudinal assessment of kidney function. Serum and urine metabolites were identi /uniFB01 ed using the same metabolomics platform and encompassed over 700 shared metabolites. However, there are several limitations of our study. Our analyses used covariates that were selfreported (hypertension medication, smoking). Because our study cohort included participants with an average baseline age of 76 years, average eGFR of above 60 ml/min per 1.73 m , as well as Black and White indi2 viduals only, our results may not be generalizable to younger populations, populations with higher prevalence of kidney disease, or other racial/ethnic groups. Because the liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy quanti -/uniFB01 -cation was relative, not absolute, we did not assess for associations between the fractional excretion of metabolites and kidney function or kidney function decline. Confounders may be measured incompletely and with error, and there may be additional confounders that were not included. For example, analyses of the effect of diet and fasting status on our /uniFB01 ndings were not conducted; previous studies in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension-Sodium trial have suggested that there may be differences in in /uniFB02 uential serum and urine biomarkers by dietary patterns. 52,53 The multimetabolite model of kidney function decline was designed to investigate the potential utility of including metabolites from both urine and serum; if optimal discrimination were the aim, performance might be further improved with a method, such as elastic net regression, that includes criteria for intermetabolite correlations. ARIC is a general population cohort of older participants, whereas GCKD consists of individuals diagnosed with CKD; the differences in the sample characteristics between the ARIC and GCKD cohorts may in /uniFB02 uence the validity of our replication.\n\nIn summary, we provide a comprehensive atlas of serum and urine metabolite associations with eGFR and albuminuria cross-sectionally and longitudinally in a large\n\n## Table 2.

Grams , 1,18 and Pascal Schlosser 4,5,19\n\n## Key Points\n\n- c We provide an atlas of cross-sectional and longitudinal serum and urine metabolite associations with eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio in an older community-based cohort.\n- c Metabolic profiling in serum and urine provides distinct and complementary insights into disease.\n\n## Abstract\n\nBackground Metabolites represent a read-out of cellular processes underlying states of health and disease.\n\nMethods We evaluated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between 1255 serum and 1398 urine known and unknown (denoted with ' X ' in name) metabolites (Metabolon HD4, 721 detected in both bio /uniFB02 uids) and kidney function in 1612 participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. All analyses were adjusted for clinical and demographic covariates, including for baseline eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) in longitudinal analyses.\n\nResults At visit 5 of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, the mean age of participants was 76 years (SD 6); 56% were women, mean eGFR was 62 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 20), and median UACR level was 13 mg/g (interquartile range, 25). In cross-sectional analysis, 675 serum and 542 urine metabolites were associated with eGFR (Bonferroni-corrected P , 4.0E-5 for serum analyses and P , 3.6E-5 for urine analyses), including 248 metabolites shared across bio /uniFB02 uids. Fewer metabolites (75 serum and 91 urine metabolites, including seven metabolites shared across bio /uniFB02 uids) were cross-sectionally associated with albuminuria. Guanidinosuccinate; N2,N2-dimethylguanosine; hydroxy-N6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine; X-13844; and X-25422 were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with both eGFR and albuminuria. Over a mean follow-up of 6.6 years, serum mannose (hazard ratio [HR], 2.3 [1.6 -3.2], P 5 2.7E-5) and urine X-12117 (HR, 1.7 [1.3 -2.2], P 5 1.9E-5) were risk factors of UACR doubling, whereas urine sebacate (HR, 0.86 [0.80 -0.92], P 5 1.9E-5) was inversely associated. Compared with clinical characteristics alone, including the top /uniFB01 ve endogenous metabolites in serum and urine associated with longitudinal outcomes improved the outcome prediction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for eGFR decline: clinical model 5 0.79, clinical 1 metabolites model 5 0.87, P 5 8.1E-6; for UACR doubling: clinical model 5 0.66, clinical 1 metabolites model 5 0.73, P 5 2.9E-5).\n\nConclusions Metabolomic pro /uniFB01 ling in different bio /uniFB02 uids provided distinct and potentially complementary insights into the biology and prognosis of kidney diseases.\n\nJASN 35: 1252 -1265, 2024. doi: https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.0000000000000403\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe kidney is an organ that interfaces between blood and urine, and its function is quanti /uniFB01 ed by the accumulation and /uniFB02 ow of small molecules or metabolites across bio /uniFB02 uids. eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) are two metrics commonly used to quantify kidney function and injury, with both metrics incorporating creatinine, a small molecule that is both /uniFB01 ltered and secreted by the kidney. Low eGFR and high UACR levels are associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes, such as kidney failure and mortality. 1 4 -\n\nMetabolomics refers to the large-scale identi /uniFB01 cation and quanti /uniFB01 cation of metabolites in biological systems. This tool, to date primarily implemented in blood, has allowed for the discovery of circulating biomarkers associated with clinical outcomes, such as CKD. 5 8 -Given the kidney s role in ' /uniFB01 ltration, both serum and urine metabolomic investigations may inform the study of kidney diseases.\n\nDue to the number of contributing authors, the affiliations are listed at the end of this article.\n\nCorrespondence: Dr. Morgan E.

We assessed these associations using the same high-throughput metabolomics platform for 1255 and 1398 metabolites in serum and urine, respectively. We also aimed to assess whether including serum, urine, or both sets of metabolites with clinical variables can improve the performance of models predicting kidney function decline.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Study Population\n\nThe Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study is an ongoing study that began in 1987 that aims to investigate causes and clinical consequences of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases with respect to demographic characteristics. 15 The study recruited 15,792 participants aged between 45 and 64 years at enrollment (visit 1) from four communities (Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; Minneapolis suburbs, MN; and Washington County, MD).\n\nOur study population was drawn from the 6538 ARIC participants who attended visit 5 (2011 -2013). To be included in the current analyses, we required that participants had non-missing eGFRcr,cys ( n 5 101 excluded), were in either the White or Black race category ( n 5 18 excluded), had no prevalent kidney failure ( n 5 36 excluded), and had both serum and urine metabolite data available with at least 50% detectable endogenous metabolites (Supplemental Figure 1). This selection resulted in a study sample of 1612 participants used in cross-sectional analyses.\n\nFor the longitudinal analyses with a 40% decline in eGFR or UACR doubling, we required that participants had at least one follow-up visit at visit 6 (2016 -2017) or 7 (2018 -2019) with non-missing eGFR or UACR data. This resulted in 942 individuals in our study population for the decline in eGFR analysis and 894 individuals for the doubling in UACR analyses. ARIC conducted active surveillance and is linked to mortality and the United States Renal Data System registries.\n\nTo assess whether including serum, urine, or both sets of metabolites improved prediction of eGFR decline or UACR doubling beyond clinical variables, individuals common to both longitudinal study samples were included ( n 5 879).\n\nReplication of longitudinal analyses were conducted in the ongoing prospective German Chronic Kidney Disease (GCKD) study, which began in 2010 and enrolled 5217 adult individuals with CKD. 16 Inclusion criteria encompassed patients regularly visited by nephrologists, with an eGFR between 30 and 60 ml min 2 1 per 1.73 m 2 or an eGFR . 60 ml min 2 1 per 1.73 m 2 along with UACR . 300 mg per gram (or urinary protein-creatinine ratio . 500 mg per gram). The GCKD study was registered in the national clinical studies registry (DRKS 00003971) and received approval from the local ethics committees at participating institutions (universities or medical faculties of Aachen, Berlin, Erlangen, Freiburg, Hannover, Heidelberg, Jena, Munchen, and Wurzburg). \u0308 \u0308 All participants provided written informed consent.\n\n## Metabolomic Profiling and Preprocessing\n\nSerum and urine samples stored at 2 80\u00b0C were sent to Metabolon, Inc. (Durham, NC) for untargeted metabolite pro /uniFB01 ling by liquid chromatography -mass spectroscopy (serum pro /uniFB01 led in 2019, urine pro /uniFB01 led in 2022). A total of 1464 serum metabolites (including 320 unnamed and 302 drug metabolites) and 1581 urine metabolites (including 467 unnamed and 382 drug metabolites) were identi /uniFB01 ed and quanti /uniFB01 ed. Metabolites were categorized into ten superpathways by Metabolon, namely amino acid, carbohydrate, cofactors and vitamins, energy, lipid, nucleotide, partially characterized molecules, peptide, unknown, and xenobiotics. Drug metabolites were excluded from our analyses (serum: 302 metabolites, urine: 382 metabolites). The preprocessing steps for serum and urine data were conducted in parallel.\n\nFirst, for both serum and urine data, each metabolite was batch normalized to account for minor instrument variations between batches per manufacturer protocol (Metabolon, Inc.). Missing values were imputed with the minimum observed value for endogenous and unnamed metabolites present in more than 20% of samples.\n\nFor urine data only, we accounted for the varying dilutions between samples using probability quotient (PQ) normalization. 17 In the context of urine metabolomics, PQ normalization operates by /uniFB01 nding a most probable dilution factor estimated from a low-missingness subset of metabolites to normalize each sample. We estimated our PQ factors for normalization on the basis of all 372 endogenous metabolites with , 1% missing sample measurements. The PQ factors were computed with the nonimputed data of these metabolites and then used to normalize the samples for the imputed urine data. In Supplemental Figure 2, we provide a plot of the PQ factors against urinary creatinine, the reference that is used clinically. 18,19\n\nFor both serum and urine data, we then rescaled each metabolite to have a median of 1 and then log2 transformed the metabolites to reduce skewness. Metabolites with variance # 0.01 were removed, and endogenous and unnamed metabolites were winsorized at 5 SDs. Finally, we excluded any metabolites with . 80% missing sample measurements.\n\nThe /uniFB01 nal dataset consisted of 1255 serum metabolites and 1398 urine metabolites, with 721 metabolites detected in both bio /uniFB02 uids.\n\nGCKDmetabolomics were quanti /uniFB01 ed from stored EDTA plasma and spot urine. Preprocessing was conducted analogously, except for winsorization, which was not performed. 20 The /uniFB01 nal dataset for the selected plasma and urine metabolites consisted of 4744 individuals with complete data.\n\n## Covariates\n\nStudy center included four categories as mentioned earlier: Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; Minneapolis suburbs, MN;andWashington County, MD. Diabetes was de /uniFB01 ned as having a blood glucose level of $ 140 mg/dl after a fasting\n\nperiod of $ 8 hours or a nonfasting blood glucose level of $ 200 mg/dl, a self-reported clinical diagnosis of diabetes, or taking medications for diabetes or high blood glucose. Systolic BP was determined using the average of the second and third sitting BP measurements of three total measurements that were taken 5 minutes apart with no change in posture. Prevalent coronary heart disease was de /uniFB01 ned as having prevalent myocardial infarction from adjudicated electrocardiogram data in visit 5, diagnosed myocardial infarction, or a history of coronary bypass or angioplasty of a coronary artery/arteries. Age, sex, race, and smoking status (current smoker, former smoker, never smoked, or unknown) were self-reported. The use of hypertension medications was ascertained by inspection of medications taken in the previous 2 weeks. The race-free 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation 21 was used to calculate the eGFR for each visit using both serum creatinine and cystatin C. Creatinine was measured using the Roche enzymatic method, whereas cystatin C was measured by immunoturbidimetry. Urine albumin (used to calculate urine albumin-creatinine ratios [UACR], i.e ., albuminuria) at each visit was quanti /uniFB01 ed by immunoturbidimetry from random urine samples. Total cholesterol, weight, and height (the latter two used to de /uniFB01 ne body mass index) were measured during visit 5. GCKD used the 2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation based on serum creatinine. 22\n\n## Statistical Analysis\n\nBaseline characteristics of the study population were summarized using means and SDs or medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for skewed distributions and for continuous variables, respectively. Categorical variables were summarized with counts and proportions. To characterize the serum and urine metabolome on a descriptive level before integrating kidney function, metabolites were sorted by their superpathways and the Spearman correlations between all pairs of metabolites were calculated. The median correlations by superpathway were then calculated excluding paired serum -serum and urine -urine metabolites that have a correlation of 1. Summary statistics of the correlations by superpathways for paired serum -urine metabolites were separately reported.\n\nIn the cross-sectional analyses to investigate associations between metabolites within each bio /uniFB02 uid and eGFR or log2(UACR), sequentially adjusted multiple linear regression models were implemented: model 1 adjusted for demographics only, that is, age, sex, race, and study center; model 2 adjusted additionally for body mass index, systolic BP, diabetes, prevalent coronary heart disease, use of hypertension medications, smoking status, and total cholesterol; model 3 adjusted additionally for log2(UACR) when assessing associations with eGFR or eGFR when assessing associations with log2(UACR).\n\nTo assess whether speci /uniFB01 c superpathways were overrepresented among the metabolites that were associated with eGFR or UACR, a permutation test was performed by repeating the regression analyses over all metabolites for a total of 1000 times. 23 Metabolite levels were permuted en bloc to retain the same correlation structure. In other words, the data structure was retained, but eGFR (or UACR)\n\nwas permuted for a total of 1000 permutations. In each permutation, all metabolite regressions were performed. The number of signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites from the original analysis was used to identify the top associations from each permutation. A superpathway was determined to be over-represented if the original number of signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites in the superpathway was greater than the number of signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites in the same superpathway in more than 95% of the permutations ( P , 0.05).\n\nIn the longitudinal analyses to investigate associations between metabolites within each bio /uniFB02 uid and 40% eGFR decline or UACR doubling from visit 5 by visit 7 (mean follow-up time of 6.6 years), three sequentially adjusted logistic regression models were considered as before. Of note, model 3 adjusted for both baseline eGFR and log2(UACR) in both analyses.\n\nMultiple tests were accounted for using a Bonferronicorrected threshold to assess for statistical signi /uniFB01 cance. Signi /uniFB01 cant serum metabolites were de /uniFB01 ned to have P , 0.05/ 1255 5 4.0E-5, whereas signi /uniFB01 cant urine metabolites were de /uniFB01 ned to have P , 0.05/1397 5 3.6E-5.\n\nMetabolites found to be signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with kidney function or kidney function decline were reassessed with model 3 in individuals strati /uniFB01 ed by diabetes status, excluding the diabetes adjustment.\n\nTo investigate whether including both urine and serum metabolites in a logistic model for a 40% decline in eGFR or UACR doubling improved discrimination as compared with clinical covariates, we /uniFB01 rst de /uniFB01 ned a model using clinical covariates described in model 3 of the longitudinal analyses, assessing performance using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Then, we evaluated models with clinical covariates 1 the top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites only, clinical covariates 1 the top /uniFB01 ve urine metabolites only, and clinical covariates 1 the top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites and top /uniFB01 veurine metabolites. The top metabolites were selected from endogenous metabolites with the lowest P values from model 3 of the longitudinal analyses. Model improvement was assessed using the difference in AUC (DeLong test). 24 GCKDanalyses did not include race and center as covariates.\n\n## Results\n\n## Baseline Characteristics of Study Populations\n\nThe study population for the cross-sectional analyses included 1612 participants with a mean age of 76 years (SD 6); 56% were women, 49% were Black, mean eGFR was 62 ml/ min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 20), and median UACR was 13 mg/g (IQR, 25) (Table 1).\n\nFor longitudinal analyses with eGFR decline as the outcome, the study population with 942 participants had a mean age of 75 years (SD 5); 59% were female, 54% were Black, the mean eGFR was 65 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 20), and the median UACR was 10 mg/g (IQR, 18). The mean time between visits was 3.4 years, and 10% ( n 5 97) people developed a 40% decline in eGFR, whereas 33% ( n 5 294) people developed doubling of UACR.\n\n## Metabolite-Metabolite Correlations\n\nIntermetabolite correlation varied across superpathways (Figure 1A). Within superpathways, median correlations were\n\nTable 1.

Metabolites within the xenobiotic superpathway had the highest correlations between serum and urine (median, 0.79; IQR, 0.19) (Figure 2B), potentially indicating the primacy of renal excretion and limited endogenous metabolism for these compounds.\n\n## Cross-Sectional Associations between Serum or Urine Metabolites and Kidney Function\n\nThere were 675 and 542 serum and urine metabolites that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with eGFR (Figure 3, A and B), including 248 shared metabolites. A higher proportion of serum metabolites were inversely associated with eGFR compared with urine metabolites (71% for serum versus 56% for urine), representing accumulation of many metabolites in lower eGFR.\n\nTop metabolites that were higher with lower eGFR included creatinine ( b 52 0.014, P , 1.0E-323), hydroxyasparagine ( b 52 0.020, P , 1.0E-323), 2,3-dihydroxy-5methylthio-4-pentenoic acid ( b 52 0.020, P , 1.0E-323), C-glycosyltryptophan ( b 52 0.020, P , 1.5E-304), and pseudouridine ( b 52 0.018, P , 7.5E-294). All but pseudouridine were classi /uniFB01 ed into the amino acid superpathway. Amino acids and carbohydrates were overrepresented within the signi /uniFB01 cant serum metabolites (Figure 4A).\n\nBy contrast, top urine metabolites included those with negative associations with eGFR, 1-methylguanidine ( b 52 0.031, P 5 6.9E-202), asymmetric dimethylarginine ( b 5 0.013, P 5 5.3E-109), and X-12117 ( b 52 0.024, P 5 9.7E-102) and positive associations with eGFR, ribitol\n\n( b 5 0.014, P 5 5.8E-98), and guanine ( b 5 0.024, P 5 4.4E92). Amino acids and carbohydrates were also found to be over-represented within signi /uniFB01 cant urine metabolites (Figure 4B).\n\n## Cross-Sectional Associations between Serum or Urine Metabolites and Albuminuria\n\nThere were 75 serum and 91 urine metabolites that were signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with log2(UACR) (Figure 3, C and D), with seven signi /uniFB01 cant metabolites being shared between both bio /uniFB02 uids. For both bio /uniFB02 uids, the number of metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with log2(UACR) were fewer than the number of metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with eGFR. The top /uniFB01 ve signi /uniFB01 -cant serum metabolites cross-sectionally associated with log2(UACR) were 3,5-dichloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid ( b 52 0.15, P 5 2.0E-44); X-24951 ( b 52 0.21, P 5 9.0E-42); 3-bromo-5-chloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid ( b 52 0.13, P 5 2.1E-33); 4-hydroxychlorothalonil ( b 52 0.15, P 5 7.4E-30); and X-11372 ( b 52 0.12, P 5 6.3E-27), and all were negatively correlated with log2(UACR); each of these named metabolites were in the xenobiotic superpathway. Amino acids and carbohydrates were over-represented within signi /uniFB01 cant serum metabolites (Figure 4C).\n\nIn contrast to /uniFB01 ndings in serum, urine lipids were over-represented in metabolite associations with albuminuria (Figure 4D). The top /uniFB01 ve signi /uniFB01 cant urine metabolites included 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-glycerophosphatidylcholine (GPC) (16:0/20:4n6) ( b 5 0.35, P 5 3.2E-117), 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPC (16:0/18:2) ( b 5 0.39, P 5 5.7E-97), 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPC (18:0/18:2) ( b 5 0.39, P 5 2.5E-71), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylGPC (16:0/18:1) ( b 5 0.30, P 5 2.8E-43), and 1-stearoyl-2arachidonoyl-GPE (18:0/20:4) ( b 5 0.13, P 5 5.9E-25), all of which were lipids.\n\nFigure 1. Heat maps of the correlations and median correlations between every serum-urine metabolite pair, organized by superpathways. (A) Correlations between serum metabolites were more positive and generally stronger than correlations between urine metabolites or serum-urine metabolites. (B) Carbohydrates were most positively correlated with each other in serum (median correlation 0.2), urine (median correlation 0.06), and between biofluids (0.07). The strongest negative correlation was between serum carbohydrates and urine nucleotides (median correlation, 20.05). The superpathway abbreviations along the x axis and y axis are amino acid (AA), carbohydrate (Carb), cofactors and vitamins (Vit), energy (E), lipid (Lip), nucleotide (Nuc), partially characterized molecules (PCM), peptide (Pep), unknown (Un), and xenobiotics (Xen).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThere were /uniFB01 ve metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with both eGFR and log2(UACR) in both bio /uniFB02 uids: guanidinosuccinate; N2,N2-dimethylguanosine; hydroxyN6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine; X-13844; and X-25422 (see Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 for their associations). All /uniFB01 ve metabolites had negative associations with eGFR in both serum and urine. On the other hand, they were all positively associated with log2(UACR) in serum. In urine, guanidinosuccinate, X-13844, and X-25422 were positively associated with log2(UACR), whereas N2,N2dimethylguanosine and hydroxy-N6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine were negatively associated with log2(UACR).\n\n## Longitudinal Associations between Serum or Urine Metabolites and Kidney Function Decline\n\nNo serum or urine metabolite was signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with a 40% decline in eGFR at the Bonferroni-corrected threshold ( P for serum 5 4.0E-5, P for urine 5 3.6E-5) (Figure 5, A and B). Serum mannose (hazard ratio [HR] 5 2.3 [1.6 -3.2], P 5 2.7E-5) and urine X-12117 (HR 5 1.7 [1.3 -2.2], P 5 1.9E-5) were positively associated with UACR doubling, whereas urine sebacate (C10-DC) (HR 5 0.86 [0.80 -0.92], P 5 1.9E-5) was inversely associated with UACR doubling (Figure 5, C and D).\n\n## Evaluation of Effect Modification by Diabetes Status\n\nThe associations between metabolites and kidney function, albuminuria, and kidney function decline were comparable regardless of diabetes status (Supplemental Figure 3). On the other hand, several metabolites had higher or lower levels by diabetes status (Supplemental\n\nTable 3). Predictably, sugars and sugar compounds, such as glucose and mannonate, had elevated levels in serum and urine among individuals with diabetes. Several N -lactoyl amino acids previously found to be risk factors of diabetic retinopathy 25 were also elevated in both serum and urine for individuals with diabetes. Serum levels of choline-containing metabolites tended to be lower in participants with diabetes.\n\n## Benefit of Measuring Metabolites in Multiple Biofluids\n\nMetabolites that were detected in both serum and urine were more likely to be associated with eGFR than metabolites that were detected in only one of the bio /uniFB02 uids (84% metabolites detected in serum and urine were signi /uniFB01 cant versus 29% metabolites detected in serum only versus 31% metabolites detected in urine only, chisquared P 5 8.9E-114), indicating the centrality of metabolite excretion in kidney function (Figure 6). Similarly, for associations with albuminuria, more shared metabolites had signi /uniFB01 cant associations compared with those detected in a single bio /uniFB02 uid (16% versus 3% versus 4%, respectively, P 5 1.7E-20). A list of the metabolites that were detected in serum only, urine only, or both serum and urine is presented in Supplemental Table 4.\n\nThe top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites associated with a 40% decline in eGFR were 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG); cysteine s-sulfate; 10-undecenoate (11:1n1); erythronate; and 1-ribosyl-imidazoleacetate, whereas the top /uniFB01 ve urine metabolites were choline; 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate; N -acetylarginine; glycerophosphoethanolamine; and glucuronide of C10H18O2 (2).

Including serum and urine metabolites signi /uniFB01 cantly increased the AUC further to 0.87 ( P for difference in AUCs between the clinical model and the clinical 1 serum 1 urine metabolites model 5 8.1E-6).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe top /uniFB01 ve serum metabolites associated with UACR doubling were mannose, N -acetylglycine, oleoylcholine, arachidonoylcholine, and g -glutamylcitrulline, whereas the top /uniFB01 ve urine metabolites were sebacate (C10-DC), I-urobilinogen, N -acetylglutamine, N -acetylcitrulline, and tridecenedioate (C13:1-DC). Including serum and urine metabolites in a prediction model of albuminuria doubling increased the AUC from 0.66 (clinical covariates only) to 0.69 (serum metabolites 1 clinical covariates, P for difference in AUC from the clinical covariates only model 5 0.012) and 0.71 (urine metabolites 1 clinical covariates, P for difference in AUC from the clinical covariates only model 5 3.6E-4). Including both serum and urine metabolites increased the AUC to 0.73 ( P for difference in AUC from the clinical covariates -only model 5 2.9E-5). To test the conclusion in an external cohort of participants with CKD, we used the same metabolites quanti /uniFB01 ed in plasma and urine in the GCKD study. Addition of blood or urine metabolomics improved risk prediction in the patients with CKD, albeit to a modest degree. Supplemental Table 5 contains the full equations for each of the above models for longitudinal risk prediction, and Supplemental Table 6 shows the Spearman correlations between the metabolites included in the models.\n\nThis large community-based study identi /uniFB01 es metabolomic correlates and antecedents of kidney parameters and kidney function decline, respectively, and suggests the utility of measuring metabolites in more than one bio /uniFB02 uid. Kidney function had a profound effect on both the circulating metabolome and the urinary metabolome. In addition, novel circulating and urinary metabolites were identi /uniFB01 ed that preceded the decline of kidney function more than 5 years in advance. Moreover, the results suggest that measurement of metabolites from multiple bio /uniFB02 uids can provide distinct and orthogonal insight into kidney disease biology and prognosis.\n\nMost prior metabolomics studies of kidney function have focused on blood metabolites and eGFR. 14,26,27 For example, a previous study discovered 65 circulating metabolites associated with eGFRcr. 14 Of the 65 metabolites, 49 were measured in our study and all displayed signi /uniFB01 cant associations with eGFRcr-cys ( P , 0.05/49), providing face validity. Similarly, several of the top serum metabolites are known markers of /uniFB01 ltration: creatinine, pseudouridine, and C-glycosyltryptophan. 28,29 Other /uniFB01 ndings expand upon the existing literature: Serum guanidinosuccinate, previously associated with kidney failure, was negatively associated with eGFR and positively associated with albuminuria. 30,31 Serum N2,N2dimethylguanosine, a modi /uniFB01 ed ribonucleoside known to be elevated in kidney failure, was associated with worse kidney function and albuminuria doubling. 32 We also found that higher levels of choline and its derivatives, such as trimethylamine N -oxide, were risk factors of kidney function or kidney function decline, although the latter associations were NS at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold. This association is consistent with various studies that have identi /uniFB01 ed choline and its derivatives as markers of renal metabolism 33 that are upregulated in AKI. 34\n\nFigure 3.

Many of the known uremic toxins, or metabolites that accumulate in serum in the setting of low eGFR ( e.g ., urea, indoxyl sulfate, kynurenines), also had negative associations with eGFR in urine. This suggests that for these metabolites, absolute levels of excretion are higher in lower eGFR, albeit insuf /uniFB01 cient to maintain a normal nonelevated level in blood. Notably, higher levels of metabolites in blood could re /uniFB02 ect retention or systemic overproduction. 35\n\nEight of the ten metabolite superpathways were overrepresented in at least one of the four cross-sectional analyses for serum or urine metabolite associations with eGFR or albuminuria. Among the metabolites associated with albuminuria, urinary lipids were over-represented. Several\n\nFigure 4.

Phosphatidylcholines are essential components of biological membranes and critical for LDL and chylomicron assembly. GPCs are also osmolytes that accumulate under hypertonic stress, which can occur in the setting of low kidney function, leading to increased levels of excretion into urine. Their increased presence in urine in the setting of albuminuria may represent damaged cell membranes or coupling with urine albumin because albumin has a high af /uniFB01 nity for lipids. 36 38 -High levels of lipids may also indicate dyslipidemia or abnormal lipid metabolism, which may cause or accelerate lipotoxicity-mediated atherosclerotic renal vascular damage, leading to albuminuria. 39 42 -\n\nMany of the metabolites detected in both serum and urine were associated with eGFR and albuminuria, which may be a direct re /uniFB02 ection of the kidney s role in ' /uniFB01 ltration.

This may re /uniFB02 ect the fact that urine levels are determined not only by /uniFB01 ltration but also by tubular secretion. Although GFR associates with the secretory clearance of drugs, 43 the relationship can be nonlinear for speci /uniFB01 c solutes, especially in advanced CKD. 44 More likely, however, is that blood levels of intravascular hydration are extraordinarily well regulated, whereas urine has a wide range of dilution that statistical methods ( e.g ., PQ normalization) can only partially address.\n\nIn longitudinal analyses, higher serum mannose and lower urine sebacate was a strong risk factor of increasing albuminuria, quanti /uniFB01 ed by UACR doubling. Previous kidney metabolomic studies have reported positive associations between serum mannose with kidney failure 45\n\nFigure 6.

Urine sebacate is a naturally occurring urine acid, and dibutyl sebacate is a common plasticizer used in the coating of sustained-release drug tablets. 47 -51 Thus, higher levels of urinary sebacate may re /uniFB02 ect use of speci /uniFB01 c medications.\n\nAlthough the aim of this work was not focused on prediction of CKD progression, simple logistic models including either serum metabolites or urine metabolites improved discrimination over a model of clinical covariates only, and the model including both serum and urine metabolites had the best discrimination among all models considered. This /uniFB01 nding was replicated in patients with CKD in the GCKD cohort. Although these /uniFB01 ndings require validation in independent studies, they lend credence to the idea that not only do both bio /uniFB02 uids provide key information in estimating kidney prognosis but also the information they provide is complementary.\n\nThis study re /uniFB02 ects one of the largest to date to use both serum and urine metabolites in the cross-sectional and longitudinal assessment of kidney function. Serum and urine metabolites were identi /uniFB01 ed using the same metabolomics platform and encompassed over 700 shared metabolites. However, there are several limitations of our study. Our analyses used covariates that were selfreported (hypertension medication, smoking). Because our study cohort included participants with an average baseline age of 76 years, average eGFR of above 60 ml/min per 1.73 m , as well as Black and White indi2 viduals only, our results may not be generalizable to younger populations, populations with higher prevalence of kidney disease, or other racial/ethnic groups. Because the liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy quanti -/uniFB01 -cation was relative, not absolute, we did not assess for associations between the fractional excretion of metabolites and kidney function or kidney function decline. Confounders may be measured incompletely and with error, and there may be additional confounders that were not included. For example, analyses of the effect of diet and fasting status on our /uniFB01 ndings were not conducted; previous studies in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension-Sodium trial have suggested that there may be differences in in /uniFB02 uential serum and urine biomarkers by dietary patterns. 52,53 The multimetabolite model of kidney function decline was designed to investigate the potential utility of including metabolites from both urine and serum; if optimal discrimination were the aim, performance might be further improved with a method, such as elastic net regression, that includes criteria for intermetabolite correlations. ARIC is a general population cohort of older participants, whereas GCKD consists of individuals diagnosed with CKD; the differences in the sample characteristics between the ARIC and GCKD cohorts may in /uniFB02 uence the validity of our replication.\n\nIn summary, we provide a comprehensive atlas of serum and urine metabolite associations with eGFR and albuminuria cross-sectionally and longitudinally in a large\n\n## Table 2.

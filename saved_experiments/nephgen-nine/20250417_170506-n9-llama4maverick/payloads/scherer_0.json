Using rare variant aggregation testing based on whole-exome sequencing data to detect genes associated with levels of 1,294 plasma and 1,396 urine metabolites, we discovered 235 genemetabolite associations, many previously unreported. Complementary approaches (genetic, computational (in silico gene knockouts in whole-body models of human metabolism) and one experimental proof of principle) provided orthogonal evidence that studies of rare, damaging variants in the heterozygous state permit inferences concordant with those from inborn errors of metabolism. Allelic series of functional variants in transporters responsible for transcellular sulfate reabsorption (SLC13A1, SLC26A1) exhibited graded effects on plasma sulfate and human height and pinpointed alleles associated with increased odds of diverse musculoskeletal traits and diseases in the population. This integrative approach can identify new players in incompletely characterized human metabolic reactions and reveal metabolic readouts informative of human traits and diseases.\n\nA complex interplay of thousands of enzymes and transport proteins is involved in maintaining physiological levels of intermediates and end products of metabolism. Disturbances of their function can result in severe diseases, such as those caused by inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs), or predispose to common metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes or gout. While the study of rare, early-onset, autosomal recessive IEMs has uncovered many metabolite-related genes, such studies are limited by the very low number of persons homozygous for the causative variants. Conversely, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in large populations have revealed thousands of common genetic variants associated with altered metabolite levels 1-13 , but these variants' functional effects are often unknown, and their modest effect sizes limit their direct clinical impact.\n\nGene-based aggregation testing of rare, putatively damaging variants in population studies can address this challenge. Previously, such studies have focused almost exclusively on the circulating\n\nA full list of affiliations appears at the end of the paper. e-mail: johannes.hertel@med.uni-greifswald.de; anna.koettgen@uniklinik-freiburg.de\n\nFig. 1 | Overview of the study design.

We have shown recently that GWASs of paired plasma and urine metabolomes do not only reveal many more associations but also enable specific insights into renal metabolite handling . We 2 therefore aimed to perform gene-based testing of the aggregate effect of rare variants on the levels of 1,294 plasma and 1,396 urine metabolites quantified from 4,737 participants in the German Chronic Kidney Disease (GCKD) study with whole-exome sequencing (WES) data to identify metabolism-related genes and to understand whether the underlying rare, almost exclusively heterozygous variants permit inferences complementary to the ones obtained from the study of IEMs.\n\nlinkage permits the systematic study of the aggregated and individual effects of rare, damaging, metabolite-associated variants on a wide variety of traits and diseases.\n\nPatients with IEMs typically show severe symptoms that originate from accumulation or depletion of metabolites, while heterozygous carriers of the causative variants often show milder changes of the same or related metabolic phenotypes 21 . We hypothesized that sex-specific analysis of metabolite-associated, X chromosomal genes as well as knowledge-based, computational modeling based on sex-specific organ-resolved whole-body models (WBMs 22 ; Methods) of human metabolism can inform on whether heterozygous damaging variants capture the metabolic effects of their unobserved homozygous counterparts. WBMs enable the investigation of homozygous gene defects through deterministic in silico knockout modeling. The resulting virtual IEMs reflect observed IEMs 22-25 . We further hypothesized that metabolite-associated rare variants identified in the GCKD study would show associations with related human traits and diseases in very large population studies and that the genetic effects would be proportional to their effects on metabolite levels if the implicated metabolites are molecular readouts of disease-relevant processes. The large UK Biobank (UKB) with WES data and extensive health record\n\nHere, we set out to perform gene-based rare variant aggregation testing to discover genes associated with metabolite levels and to characterize their genetic architecture with respect to the identified variants and across plasma and urine. We validate identified genes and variants and the range of their effects through complementary genetic approaches, with a new computational method based on WBMs 22,23 and through proof-of-principle experimental studies, and identify traits and diseases for which these metabolites represent molecular readouts.\n\n## Results\n\nAs summarized in Fig. 1, rare, putatively damaging variants were identified in 16,525 genes based on WES data from 4,737 GCKD study participants (mean age of 60 years, 40% women; Supplementary Table 1). Metabolites were determined by nontargeted mass spectrometry and covered a wide variety of superpathways (Metabolon HD4 platform; Supplementary Table 2). Exome-wide burden tests for the association between each gene and the levels of each of 1,294 plasma and 1,396 urine metabolites (781 overlapping) were carried out using two complementary 'masks' that differed in the selection of qualifying variants (QVs; Methods) for gene-based aggregation. While the 'LoF\\_mis' mask contained a median of eight QVs per gene predicted to be either high-confidence loss-of-function (LoF) variants or deleterious missense or in-frame nonsynonymous variants, the 'HI\\_mis' mask contained a median of 16 QVs per gene predicted\n\nas high-impact consequence (transcript ablation or amplification, splice acceptor or donor, stop-gain, frameshift, start or stop lost) or as deleterious missense variants using additional prediction scores (Methods). Both masks assume a LoF mechanism but account for different genetic architectures.\n\n## Discovery of 192 significant gene-metabolite associations\n\nWe identified 192 significant gene-metabolite pairs across both plasma ( P value &lt; 5.04 \u00d7 10 -9 ) and urine ( P value &lt; 4.46 \u00d7 10 -9 ), where 43 associations were detected in both (192 + 43 associations overall; Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 3). These involved 73 unique genes and 179 metabolites, with a comparable number of genes and metabolites identified in plasma and urine. There were 22 and 17 genes with significant associations exclusively in plasma and in urine, respectively. While the majority of associations was detected with both masks, the more inclusive 'HI\\_mis' mask yielded more mask-specific associations than the 'LoF\\_mis' mask (Fig. 2b). Amino acids and lipids were the dominating pathways among the associated metabolites (Supplementary Fig. 1). The higher proportion of implicated lipids in plasma than in urine is consistent with the absence of glomerular filtration of many lipids (Fig. 2b). Associations detected in both plasma and urine generally affected the levels of the implicated metabolite in the same direction (Fig. 2a). Sensitivity analyses evaluating additional masks and methods for aggregation testing (LoF only, sequence kernel association test (SKAT) and SKAT- optimal unified test (SKAT-O)) as well as sex-stratified and kidney function-stratified analyses supported the robustness of the main findings (Supplementary Results, Extended Data Figs. 1-3 and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5).\n\nPrevious  independent  studies  of  associations  between sequencing-based rare variants and metabolite levels obtained using comparable technology have focused on plasma and serum 14,15,19,20 . Comparison of the 128 discovered gene-plasma metabolite associations in this study with previous studies 14,15,19,20 showed that 69% (88 of 128) were not reported previously, although 93% (82 of 88) of the new findings involved metabolites analyzed before (Supplementary Table 6; detailed description in the Supplementary Methods and the Supplementary Results).\n\nThe 73 unique metabolite-associated genes were strongly overrepresented among genes known to be causative for IEMs (odds ratio = 10.6, P value = 1.9 \u00d7 10 -14 ; Supplementary Methods), with 28 (38%) of them currently known to harbor causative mutations (Supplementary Table 6). The QVs detected in our study of middle-aged and older adults were almost exclusively observed in the heterozygous state (Supplementary Data 1). Detailed annotation of QVs in the two masks (Supplementary Table 7) showed that 63 unique QVs in 15 genes and 73 unique QVs in 17 genes were listed in ClinVar as 'pathogenic' or 'pathogenic or likely pathogenic' for a corresponding monogenic disease. These observations support the notion that gene-based aggregation of rare, heterozygous, putatively damaging variants effectively identifies gene-metabolite relationships implicated in human diseases.\n\nFig. 2 | Overview of the 192 identified gene-metabolite associations across plasma and urine and their corresponding pathways. a , Significant associations with plasma metabolites are shown on the outermost band (red; shading reflects effect direction), with genes ordered by chromosomal location across the genome. Associations with urine metabolites are shown on the middle band (blue; shading reflects effect direction). Gene-metabolite associations are based on rare variant aggregation testing from both masks. The ones labeled in gray were already reported in previous rare variant studies 14-20,24 , whereas the ones labeled in black are considered new. White spaces indicate that no significant association was detected in a given matrix. For all associations detected in both matrices, effect directions are consistent. The inner band represents the superpathway of the associated metabolite. GPE, glycero-3phosphoethanolamine; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; DC, dicarboxylic\n\n## Validation through independent, complementary approaches\n\nIndependent replication of our findings is complicated by differences in QVs, metabolite quantification methods and different analytical choices across studies. We therefore validated our findings using four complementary approaches: first, the large UKB permitted analysis of the same rare QVs using the same analytical choices (Methods), as in our study for two overlapping metabolites, and showed very similar effect sizes for gene-metabolite associations (Fig. 3a). Second, the UKB proteomics data 26 contain information on circulating levels of the encoded proteins of 17 genes implicated in our study. Burden tests aggregating protein-truncating and rare damaging variants revealed associations with lower levels of 15 of these proteins (in cis , P value &lt; 1 \u00d7 10 -5 ; Fig. 3b) 27 , potentially explained by nonsense-mediated decay. Third, comparison of our findings to those from a previous study of the plasma metabolome 15 showed highly correlated effect sizes with those from our study, both on the variant level and the aggregated level (Spearman correlation coefficient &gt; 0.8; Fig. 3c,d and Supplementary Table 8).\n\nLastly, we performed a proof-of-concept experimental validation study for an implicated gene-metabolite relationship. The B AT1 0 transporter, encoded by SLC6A19 , is responsible for the uptake of neutral amino acids across the apical membrane of intestinal and kidney epithelial cells 28 . In addition to associations with the levels of the known substrates asparagine, histidine and tryptophan, we also detected associations with methionine sulfone, not yet reported as a substrate. Transport studies in CHO cells overexpressing human SLC6A19 and its co-chaperone collectrin (CLTRN) in comparison to the control indeed confirmed methionine sulfone to be a substrate of the transporter in vitro, in a similar concentration range as its known substrate isoleucine (Fig. 4a and the Methods). Specificity was shown by complete inhibition of transport activity upon application of the SLC6A19 inhibitor cinromide 29 (Fig. 4b). Together, these four complementary lines of evidence all support the validity of the detected associations.\n\n## Prioritization and characteristics of driver variants\n\nWe next performed a forward selection procedure 15 to assess the contribution of individual QVs to their gene-based association signals (Methods). Plots that visualize the association P value based on the successive aggregation of the most influential QVs (Supplementary Data 2) revealed noteworthy differences across genes and metabolites, with examples detailed in the Supplementary Results.\n\nThe inclusion of effectively neutral variants among the QVs may dilute their joint signal. We thus prioritized the variants with the strongest individual contributions that resulted in the lowest possible association P value when aggregated for burden testing 15 as 'driver variants' (Methods). For each significant association signal, we identified at least two and up to 48 driver variants (median of 13; Supplementary Data 2 and Supplementary Tables 3 and 7). The proteins encoded by the vast majority of identified genes are directly involved in the generation, turnover or transport of the associated acid. b , The UpSet plot shows the number of identified gene-metabolite associations by mask and matrix, color coded by the respective metabolite superpathway. Right, horizontal bar plot represents the total number of associations identified by mask and matrix. The proportion of lipids is markedly higher among associations detected with plasma metabolites as compared with urine. Top left, vertical bar plot shows the number of shared associations by mask and matrix, while the sets among which the associations are shared are indicated below each column. While the majority of associations are detected by both masks, especially the less-stringent HI\\_mis mask provides many mask-specific findings in both plasma and urine. The group of metabolites detected in both plasma and urine is dominated by amino acids.

Bars represent corresponding standard errors (SE), symbol color reflects the -log 10 ( P value), and the size depicts the cumulative minor allele frequency of all QVs within a gene. In the UKB, gene-based burden tests were performed as implemented in REGENIE (Methods). cMAF, cumulative MAF. b , Plasma levels of the proteins encoded by 17 of the 73 significant, metabolite-associated genes were measured in the UKB ( N \u2265 44,108) 27 . Among the available gene-level summary statistics 27 , 15 genes showed cis associations with plasma protein levels with an association P value &lt; 1 \u00d7 10 -5 based on a 'ptvraredmg' mask, which is similar to the masks used in the GCKD study. Genes are shown on the y axis. Effect sizes and the corresponding standard errors of the cis associations with plasma protein levels based on these summary statistics 27 are displayed on the x axis. Symbol color reflects the -log 10 ( P value). For all cis associations, the direction of effect sizes was negative, consistent with LoF variants resulting in lower plasma protein levels. c , Single-variant effect sizes on levels of a given plasma metabolite in the GCKD study ( x axis) were very similar to those in the INTERVAL study (Bomba et al. 15 ) ( y axis) for all QVs involved in metabolite(s). It is therefore a reasonable assumption that truly functional variants are those with the strongest individual contributions to the association signal with the implicated metabolite. Indeed, the minimum association P value based on only driver variants was often many orders of magnitude lower than the one obtained from all QVs, as exemplified by DPYD and plasma uracil (Supplementary Data 2). As expected, the proportion of splice, stop-gain and frameshift variants was higher among driver QVs, whereas nondriver QVs contained a greater proportion of missense variants (Fisher's exact test,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsignificant gene-metabolite associations in the GCKD study that were also available in the INTERVAL study and showed an association P value &lt; 0.1 in both studies.

The depicted 200 associations involved 35 unique genes and 75 unique metabolites. Symbol color indicates the INTERVAL association P value. Gray lines represent identity (dotted) and the linear regression line (dashed). The strong correlation of effect sizes supports reproducibility. d , Summary statistics for 89 of 128 plasma genemetabolite associations were available in the INTERVAL study (Bomba et al.). Effect sizes of gene-metabolite associations on the aggregated level in the GCKD study ( x axis) were very similar to those in the INTERVAL study ( y axis; Methods and Supplementary Table 8), despite differences in masks and aggregation unit. Horizontal error bars indicate the standard errors of effect sizes in the GCKD study. Standard errors were not available in the summary statistics from Bomba et al. Symbol shape indicates the corresponding mask used by Bomba et al. (LOF, high-confidence LoF variants; MLOF, LoF and missense variants combined; CODING, all rare exonic variants, splice sites and variants residing in untranslated regions). Color reflects the association P value in the INTERVAL study. Gray lines represent the identity (dotted) and the linear regression line (dashed).\n\nP value = 1.3 \u00d7 10 -6 ; Extended Data Fig. 4a). The median effect of driver variants on metabolite levels increased from missense over start/stop lost, frameshift and stop-gain variants to variants predicted to affect splicing (Extended Data Fig. 4b). The median effect of drivers also increased with lower minor allele count and differed substantially from the one of nondrivers in each minor allele count bin (Extended Data Fig. 4c).\n\nLastly, evaluation of the convergence of rare and common variant association signals showed that the associations of rare and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n-50\n\nFig. 4 | Methionine sulfone is a direct SLC6A19 substrate in vitro. a , Transport of L-isoleucine and methionine sulfone in CHO cells overexpressing SLC6A19 (SLC6A19 cells) and its chaperone CLTRN versus mock cells.

EC 50 , half-maximum\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncommon variants in the same region with a given metabolite were independent (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Table 9 and Extended Data Fig. 5).\n\n## Heterozygous variants inform about dose-response effects\n\nThe identification of known IEM-causing variants such as in CTH PAH , , SLC6A19 and SLC7A9 (Supplementary Table 7) in the heterozygous state supports the notion that heterozygous QVs are functional alleles that lead to more extreme metabolic changes when present homozygously. For three genes with a homozygous QV present in more than one individual in our study, homozygous individuals tended to have more extreme metabolite levels than heterozygous ones (Extended Data Fig. 6), supporting a dose-response effect. Moreover, we had previously confirmed experimentally that heterozygous sulfate-associated QVs in SLC26A1 detected by aggregate variant testing are indeed LoF alleles and that the encoded protein is an important player in human sulfate homeostasis 30 . However, experimental studies of each of the 2,077 QVs and 73 genes detected here are infeasible, and IEMs are so rare that no homozygous person for a given gene may have been observed yet. We therefore used three orthogonal approaches: examination of hemizygosity, in silico knockout modeling and investigation of variants prioritized through allelic series, to evaluate whether the observed metabolite-associated heterozygous variants captured similar information about a gene's function as might be derived from homozygous damaging variants in the respective gene.\n\n## X chromosomal genes as a readout of variant homozygosity\n\nGenes in the non-pseudo-autosomal region of the X chromosome offer an opportunity to study differences between heterozygous women and effectively homozygous (that is, hemizygous) men. We therefore investigated sex differences for the two X chromosomal genes identified in our screen, TMLHE and RGN (Supplementary Table 10).\n\nIndeed, male carriers of QVs in TMLHE showed clearly higher urine levels of N N N 6 , 6 , 6 -trimethyllysine, the substrate of the encoded enzyme trimethyllysine dioxygenase, than female carriers as well as markedly lower levels of its product hydroxyN N N 6 , 6 , 6 -trimethyllysine, especially when focusing on driver variants (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 10). In plasma, male QV carriers showed 1.15 s.d. lower levels of plasma hydroxyN N N 6 , 6 , 6 -trimethyllysine than noncarriers ( P value = 6 \u00d7 10 -44 ), whereas female QV carriers only showed 0.45 s.d. lower metabolite levels than noncarriers ( P value = 3 \u00d7 10 -4 ). A similar tendency was observed for RGN and urine levels of the unnamed metabolite X-23436. Levels were higher among both male and female carriers (Supplementary Table 10), suggesting that X-23436 is a metabolite upstream of the reaction catalyzed by the encoded regucalcin. Data from the GTEx Project 31 show no sex differences in gene expression across tissues. Hence, sex-differential effects on metabolite levels likely represent a dose-response effect resulting from heterozygosity versus hemizygosity of the involved QVs.\n\n## Virtual IEMs mirror the effects of heterozygous variants\n\nWe next investigated the implicated genes' LoF by generating virtual IEMs for 24 genes that covered 60 gene-metabolite pairs via in silico knockout modeling (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 7). We compared the maximal secretion flux of the implicated metabolite into blood and/or urine between the wild-type WBM and the gene-knockout WBM. Initially, the direction of the observed gene-metabolite associations was correctly predicted by virtual IEMs with an accuracy of 73.3% in the male WBM and 76.7% in the female WBM, which is significantly better than chance (Fisher's exact test, P value = 3.3 \u00d7 10 -3 (male), P value = 1.5 \u00d7 10 -4 (female); Supplementary Table 11). After model curation informed by the observed gene-metabolite associations, which included the addition of metabolites (for example, 8-methoxykynurenate) and pathways as well as alteration of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCarriers of QVs in\n\nTMLHE\n\nCarriers of QVs in\n\nTMLHE\n\nconstraints (for example, diet; details in the Supplementary Results and Supplementary Table 12), the number of modeled gene-metabolite associations increased to 67, and accuracy increased to 79.1%\n\n(male, P value = 2.1 \u00d7 10 -5 ) and 83.58% (female, P value = 2.9 \u00d7 10 -7 ). These findings underline the predictive nature of the virtual IEMs for the aggregated effects of heterozygous damaging variants and\n\nhighlight opportunities to further improve WBMs by curation of the underlying knowledge base.\n\n## Personalized WBMs capture observed metabolic changes\n\nVirtual IEMs as described above only allow for qualitative prediction. To additionally study an equivalent to observed effect sizes, we introduced a second modeling strategy (Extended Data Fig. 7) as proof of principle, focusing on the gene KYNU . We successfully generated 569 microbiome-personalized 32 WBMs (Methods) and calculated the effect size of in silico KYNU knockout on metabolite excretion into urine against the natural variation induced by the personalized microbiomes (Supplementary Table 13). Eighteen of 257 metabolites had a modeling P value &lt; 0.05/257, implicating them as potential biomarkers of the corresponding IEM kynureninase deficiency (Supplementary Table 14). The in silico effects of these 18 biomarkers, mostly belonging to tryptophan metabolism and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)  de novo + synthesis pathway, were significantly correlated with their observed counterparts (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Whereas two of the three metabolites with particularly large effects in both in silico modeling and the GCKD study, xanthurenate and 3-hydroxykynurenine, are known biomarkers of kynureninase deficiency 33 , 8-methoxykynurenate was not. We therefore measured absolute levels of these metabolites in urine samples from a homozygous patient with kynureninase deficiency and her parents 34 (Supplementary Methods) and confirmed that, in addition to xanthurenate and 3-hydroxykynurenine, 8-methoxykynurenate also constituted a biomarker of this IEM (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 8), consistent with the association statistics from aggregate tests of heterozygous variants from the GCKD study. A similar observation was made with regard to the gene PAH (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Fig. 2b and Supplementary Results). Thus, in silico knockout modeling of two proof-of-principle examples faithfully captured metabolic changes observed for heterozygous variants detected in population studies and for the corresponding recessively inherited IEMs.\n\n## Metabolites represent intermediate readouts of human traits\n\nAllelic series describe a dose-response relationship, in which increasingly deleterious mutations in a gene result in increasingly larger effects on a trait or a disease. We hypothesized that genetic effects on metabolite levels should manifest as allelic series if the metabolite represents a molecular readout of an underlying (patho-)physiological process. As proof of principle, we investigated plasma sulfate because of solid evidence for causal gene-metabolite relationships: first, QVs in SLC13A1 showed a significant aggregate effect on lower plasma sulfate levels ( P value = 3 \u00d7 10 -18 , lowest possible P value = 2 \u00d7 10 -25 ). The observed association is well supported by experimental studies establishing that the encoded Na -sulfate cotransporter NaS1 (SLC13A1) reabsorbs + filtered sulfate at the apical membrane of kidney tubular epithelial cells 35 . Second, we had previously confirmed experimentally that plasma sulfate-associated QVs in SLC26A1 are LoF alleles that lead to reduced sulfate transport 30 , consistent with the aggregate effect of\n\n## Fig. 6 | Altered metabolite levels are a readout of impaired KYNU and PAH\n\nfunction: converging evidence from three approaches.a b , , Three panels are shown for 8-methoxykynurenate levels associated with KYNU ( a ) and for phenylalanine levels associated with PAH ( b ) that visualize evidence from three complementary approaches.

The encoded sulfate transporter SAT1 localizes to basolateral membranes of tubular epithelial cells and works in series with NaS1 to mediate transcellular sulfate reabsorption (Fig. 7a) 36,37 .\n\nBased on a growth retardation phenotype in Slc13a1 -knockout mice 38 and an association between SLC13A1 and lower sitting height in the UKB ( P value = 3 \u00d7 10 -8 ; Supplementary Tables 15 and 39), we investigated relations of six functional driver QVs in SLC13A1 and SLC26A1 with anthropometric measurements in the UKB (Methods). Supplementary Table 16 contains traits with which at least two QVs showed nominally significant associations ( P value &lt; 0.05). The genetic effect sizes on plasma sulfate levels in the GCKD study and both sitting and standing heights in the UKB were correlated (Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.57 and 0.70, respectively; Fig. 7b). These observations support a causal relationship between transcellular sulfate reabsorption and human height and designate plasma sulfate as an intermediate readout. Additionally, we observed significantly lower standing height among carriers of driver variants in SLC13A1 and SLC26A1 than among noncarriers in a subsample of the GCKD study ( N = 3,239) with measured height. The aggregated effect size of driver variants in SLC13A1 was -0.54 (corresponding to -5.17 cm when height was not inverse normal transformed, P value = 1.6 \u00d7 10 -3 ; Supplementary Fig. 3a). For SLC26A1 , we obtained even a stronger effect size of -0.73 (corresponding to -6.68 cm, P value = 1.7 \u00d7 10 -6 ; Supplementary Fig. 3b).\n\nThe first patient homozygous for a LoF stop-gain mutation in SLC13A1 , p.Arg12*, has just been described 39 . Aside from sitting height &gt;2 s.d. below the normal range, the patient featured multiple skeletal abnormalities. Experimental transport studies 40 as well as the patient's fractional sulfate excretion of almost 100% 39 establish this variant as a complete LoF, resulting in renal sulfate wasting. In this study, we found that, compared with noncarriers of p.Arg12*, heterozygous carriers showed 0.95 s.d. lower plasma sulfate levels (GCKD, 22 carriers, P value = 9.9 \u00d7 10 -10 ) and 0.08 s.d. lower sitting height (UKB, 2,480 carriers, P value = 2.2 \u00d7 10 -7 ). Plasma sulfate measurements from heterozygous carriers therefore are indicative of more extreme phenotypic changes in homozygous carriers.\n\n## Variants altering sulfate uptake and musculoskeletal traits\n\nRare LoF variants in SLC13A1 and SLC26A1 have been linked to individual musculoskeletal phenotypes through IEMs and GWASs 30,41-43 . We further investigated the association between the same six functional, sulfate-associated QVs in SLC13A1 and SLC26A1 and musculoskeletal disorders, fractures and injuries in the UKB, for which at least two carriers with and without disease were present (Methods). There were 116 nominally significant ( P value &lt; 0.05) associations with clinical traits and diseases, 113 of which were associated with increased odds of disease (Fig. 7c). For instance, the odds of various fractures ranged up to 30.7 (closed fracture of the neck, P value = 2.1 \u00d7 10 -8 , NaS1 p.Trp48*; Supplementary Table 17). While the increased odds a , Right, multiple-reaction monitoring ( m z / 220.0 \u2192 174.1) chromatograms of the diluted urine of a child with a homozygous loss of KYNU function 34 (patient), the heterozygous mother and the healthy father (maternal uniparental isodisomy).

The signal at 85.5 min represents phenylalanine (Phe). The signal at 106 min is the internal standard (IS). The reference range for phenylalanine concentrations in children is 38-137 \u00b5mol l -1 and in adults is 26-91 \u00b5mol l -1 .\n\nsupport a relationship between LoF variants in sulfate transporters and predisposition to several musculoskeletal disorders, the power to detect decreased odds was limited because of the rareness of the QVs and many of the disorders.\n\nUKB participants who carried more than one copy of any of the six QVs were investigated more closely. The rare allele, resulting in the p.Arg272Cys substitution in NaS1, was observed in nine heterozygous carriers in the GCKD study and prioritized because of its location in a\n\n## 8-methoxykynurenate and KYNU a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFig. 7 | Impact of functional QVs in SLC13A1 and SLC26A1 on height, musculoskeletal traits and fractures supports the role of plasma sulfate as an intermediate readout.a , Schematic representation of the sulfate reabsorption mechanism involving NaS1 encoded by SLC13A1 at the apical membrane and SAT1 encoded by SLC26A1 at the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells.

In the UKB, we found 294 heterozygous carriers of p.Arg272Cys, four persons who carried both p.Arg272Cys in NaS1 and p.Leu348Pro in SAT1 and a single person homozygous for p.Arg272Cys. Age- and sex-specific   scores for human z height showed a clear dose-response effect (Fig. 8a and the Methods). The stronger effects among the four individuals heterozygous for LoF variants in each of the two transcellular sulfate reabsorption proteins as compared with heterozygous carriers of p.Arg272Cys only support additive effects across the pathway for human growth. Carrier status for NaS1 p.Arg272Cys was associated with increased odds of several musculoskeletal diseases such as back pain and intervertebral disk disorders as well as fractures (Fig. 8b). Homozygous persons were also identified for NaS1 p.Arg12* and SAT1 p.Leu348Pro, with similar findings (Extended Data Fig. 10). Together, these findings provide strong support that genetic variants that proxy lower transcellular sulfate reabsorption are associated with human height and several musculoskeletal traits and diseases. Prioritizing variants with strong effects in allelic series for subsequent investigation in larger studies, even if the biomarker association rests on only a few heterozygous alleles, can therefore be an effective strategy to gain insights into the impact of rare damaging variants on human health.\n\n## Relation of metabolite-associated genes to clinical traits\n\nA query of associations between the identified 2,077 QVs and 73 genes with thousands of quantitative and binary health outcomes using data from ~450,000 UKB participants (Supplementary Methods) revealed multiple biologically plausible significant and suggestive associations for genes (Supplementary Table 15) and QVs (Supplementary Table 18) but also less-studied relationships (Supplementary Results). The genes SLC47A1 SLC6A19 SLC7A9 , , and SLC22A7 were associated with one or more measures of kidney function and encode transport proteins highly expressed in the kidney 44-46 . Their localization at the apical 44-46 versus basolateral membrane of tubular epithelial kidney cells 47 corresponded to the matrix (urine versus plasma) in which they left corresponding metabolic fingerprints. This observation illustrates that rare genetic\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nb\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nvariants associated with clinical markers of organ function can leave specific signatures in organ-adjacent biofluids that reflect their roles in cellular exchange processes.\n\n## Discussion\n\nWe performed a comprehensive screen of the aggregate effect of rare, putatively damaging variants on the levels of 1,294 plasma and 1,396 urine metabolites from paired specimens of 4,737 persons. The majority of the 192 identified gene-metabolite relationships have not been reported yet 14-20,24 and include plasma- and urine-exclusive associations that reflect organ function. The findings were validated through primary data analysis for metabolites available in the UKB, investigation of previously published summary statistics from sequencing-based genetic studies of the plasma metabolome, integration of orthogonal plasma proteomics data and proof-of-concept experimental studies that confirmed a new metabolite association with the transport protein encoded by SLC6A19 .\n\nWe show, via several genetic, computational and experimental  approaches that the rare, almost exclusively heterozygous metabolite-associated variants in our study capture similar information about a gene's function as can be obtained from the study of rare IEMs but are observed much more frequently and permit insights into graded effects of impaired gene function. First, 38% of identified genes in our study are known to harbor causative mutations for autosomal recessively inherited IEMs that often exhibit concordant but more extreme changes in the implicated metabolite, as exemplified by elevated urine levels of cystine in cystinuria (MIM 220100, SLC7A9 ) or tryptophan in Hartnup disease (MIM 234500, SLC6A19 ).\n\nSecond, men exhibited significantly larger effects of rare QVs in non-pseudo-autosomal X chromosomal genes on metabolite levels than women. This observation is consistent with male hemizygosity as an approximation of female homozygosity for a given variant and with the known greater penetrance and severity of X-linked disorders in men than in women 48 .\n\nThird, in silico knockout in a virtual metabolic human, that is, full loss of gene function, was predictive for observed metabolic changes associated with variant heterozygosity. Predicted changes on metabolite levels upon in silico gene knockout were also reflected in absolute metabolite quantification of patients with IEM homozygous for a LoF mutation in the respective genes, KYNU 34 and PAH . Thus, deterministic, knowledge-based in silico modeling generated context for better biological interpretation also of heterozygous variants, while genetic screens of metabolite levels in population studies permit the identification of knowledge gaps and errors in WBMs. Our modeling pipeline for generating virtual IEMs, which we make publicly available to substantiate evidence from rare variant aggregation tests, will constitute a valuable resource in particular to scrutinize genes for which an IEM has yet to be observed.\n\nFourth, the presence of different causal QVs affecting a given metabolic reaction or pathway enabled the investigation of allelic series. The resulting dose-response relationships proxy a range of target inhibition, which represents desirable information for drug development and is relevant because enzymes and transporters are attractive drug targets. Plasma sulfate-associated functional QVs in SLC13A1 and SLC26A1 showed a clear dose-response effect between the degree of genetically inferred impaired transcellular sulfate reabsorption\n\nand lower human height. This observation is biologically plausible, because defects in genes linked to sulfate biology often result in perturbed skeletal growth and development 49 . In particular, constitutive knockouts of Slc13a1 and Slc26a1 in mice do not only cause hyposulfatemia and renal sulfate wasting 38,50 but also general growth retardation in Slc13a1 -knockout mice 38 . Interestingly, the missense variant p.Thr185Met in SAT1 exhibited the largest effect on sulfate. We have previously shown experimentally a dominant negative mechanism of this variant 30 , providing another mechanism of how heterozygous variants may promote insights into an effectively full loss of gene function. Moreover, our findings for the p.Arg272Cys variant in NaS1 show that even very few, heterozygous copies of a metabolite-prioritized QV can give rise to the detection of homozygous individuals and hitherto unreported disease associations in subsequent larger studies. These observations suggest that the importance of impaired transcellular epithelial sulfate transport for musculoskeletal diseases, fractures and injuries deserves additional study and should be further substantiated through conditional or mediation analyses if plasma sulfate levels become available in the UKB.\n\nPotential limitations of our study include a focus on participants of European ancestry with moderately reduced kidney function, potential violations of assumptions underlying burden tests, in silico prediction of QV pathogenicity and of whole-body modeling and the use of semi-quantitative rather than absolute metabolite levels. Arguments mitigating each of these concerns are detailed in the Supplementary Discussion.\n\nIn conclusion, exome-wide population studies of rare, putative LoF variants can reveal potentially causal relationships with metabolites and highlight metabolic biomarkers informative of the degree of impaired gene function that can translate into graded associations with human traits.\n\n## Online content\n\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code availability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-024-01965-7.\n\n## References\n\n- 1.

Inclusion criteria were an age between 18 and 74 years and an eGFR between 30 and 60 ml min -1 per 1.73 m  or an eGFR &gt;60 ml min 2 -1 per 1.73 m 2 with a UACR &gt;300 mg per g or with a urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio &gt;500 mg per g 52 . Biomaterials, including blood and urine, were collected at the baseline visit, processed and shipped frozen to a central biobank for storage at -80 \u00b0C 53 . Details on the study design and participant characteristics have been published 52,54 . The GCKD study was registered in the national registry for clinical studies (DRKS 00003971) and approved by local ethics committees of the participating institutions 52 . All participants provided written informed consent.\n\n## Whole-exome sequencing and quality control\n\nGenomic DNA was extracted from whole blood and underwent paired-end 100-bp WES at Human Longevity, using the IDT xGen version 1 capture kit on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. More than 97% of consensus coding sequence (CCDS) release 22 (ref. 55) had at least 10-fold coverage. The average coverage of the CCDS was 141-fold read depth. Exomes were processed from their unaligned FASTQ state in a custom-built cloud compute platform using the Illumina DRAGEN Bio-IT Platform Germline Pipeline version 3.0.7 at AstraZeneca's Centre for Genomics Research, including alignment of reads to the GRCh38 reference genome (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/001/405/GCA\\_000001405.15\\_GRCh38/) and variant calling 56 .\n\nSample-level quality control included removal of samples from participants who withdrew consent, duplicated samples, those with an estimated VerifyBamID contamination level &gt;4% 57 , samples with inconsistency between reported and genetically predicted sex, samples not having chromosomes XX or XY, samples having &lt;94.5% of CCDS release 22 bases covered with \u226510-fold coverage 55 , related samples with kinship &gt;0.884 (KING, kinship version 2.2.3) 58 and samples with a missing call rate &gt;0.03. Furthermore, only samples with available high-quality DNA microarray genotype data and without outlying values (&gt;8 s.d.) along any of the first ten genetic principle components from a principal component analysis 59 were kept, for a final sample size of 4,779 samples.\n\nVariant-level quality control was performed similar to that in ref. 56, excluding variants with coverage &lt;10, heterozygous variants with a one-sided binomial exact test P value &lt;1 \u00d7 10 -6 for HardyWeinberg equilibrium, variants with a genotype quality score &lt;30, single-nucleotide variants with a Fisher's strand bias score (FS) &gt;60 and insertions and deletions with an FS &gt;200, variants with a mapping quality score &lt;40, those with a quality score &lt;30, variants with a read position rank-sum score &lt;-2, those with a mapping quality rank-sum score &lt;-8, variants that did not pass the DRAGEN calling algorithm filters, heterozygous genotype called variants based on an alternative allele read ratio &lt;0.2 or &gt;0.8 and variants with a missing call rate &gt;10% among all remaining samples. This resulted in 1,038,062 variants across the autosomes and the X chromosome.\n\n## Variant and gene annotation\n\nVariants from WES were annotated using the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) version 101 (ref. 60) with standard settings, including the canonical transcript, gene symbol and variant frequencies from gnomAD version 2.1 (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/). VEP plugins were used to add the REVEL (version 2020-5) 61 and CADD (version 3.0) 62 scores and to downgrade LoF variants using LOFTEE (version 20208) 63 . Furthermore, we added multiple in silico prediction scores using dbNSFP version 4.1a 64 .\n\nFor interpretation, genes were annotated for their potential function as enzymes using UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org/) 65 and as transporters using data from Gyimesi and Hediger 66 .\n\n## Metabolite identification and quantification\n\nMetabolite levels were quantified from stored plasma and spot urine as published by Schlosser et al. . In brief, nontargeted mass spectrometry 2 analysis was conducted at Metabolon. Metabolites were identified by automated comparison of the ion features in the experimental sample to a reference library of chemical standards. Known metabolites reported in this study were identified with the highest confidence level of identification of the Metabolomics Standards Initiative 67,68 , unless marked with an asterisk. Unnamed biochemicals of unknown structural identity were identified by virtue of their recurrent nature. For peak quantification, the area under the curve was used, followed by normalization to account for interday instrument variation.\n\n## Data cleaning of quantified metabolites\n\nData cleaning, quality control, filtering and normalization of quantified metabolites in plasma and urine in the GCKD study were performed using an in-house pipeline . Samples and metabolites were evaluated 2 for duplicates; missing and outlying values and metabolites with low variance were excluded. Levels of urine metabolites were normalized using the probabilistic quotient 69 derived from 309 endogenous metabolites with &lt;1% missing values to account for differences in urine dilution. After removing metabolites with &lt;300 individuals with WES data, the remaining 1,294 plasma and 1,396 urine metabolites (Supplementary Table 2) were inverse normal transformed before gene-based aggregation testing. Therefore, effect sizes based on effects of aggregated rare variants on the semi-quantitative metabolite measurements have 1 s.d. as a unit.\n\n## Additional variables\n\nSerum and urine creatinine were measured using an IDMS-traceable enzymatic assay (Creatinine Plus, Roche). Serum and urine albumin levels were measured using the Tina-quant assay (Roche-Hitachi Diagnostics). GFR was estimated with the CKD-EPI formula 70 from serum creatinine. UACR was calculated using urinary albumin and creatinine measurements. Full information on WES data, covariates and metabolites was available for 4,713 persons regarding plasma metabolites and for 4,619 persons regarding urine metabolites. Genetic principal components were derived based on principal component analysis on the basis of genotype data using flashpca 71 .\n\n## Rare variant aggregation testing on metabolite levels\n\nWe performed burden tests to combine the effects of rare, putatively damaging variants within a gene on metabolite levels assuming a LoF mechanism that results in concordant effect directions on metabolite levels 72 . The selection of high-quality QVs into masks based on their frequency and annotated properties is a state-of-the-art approach in variant aggregation studies 73 . Annotations from VEP version 101 (ref. 60) were used to select QVs within each gene for aggregation in burden tests. Because genetic architectures of damaging variants vary across genes, two complementary masks for the selection of QVs were defined. Both masks were restricted to contain only rare variants in canonical transcripts with MAF &lt;1%. All variants that were predicted to be either high-confidence LoF variants or missense variants with a MetaSVM score &gt;0 or in-frame nonsynonymous variants with a fathmm-XF-coding score &gt;0.5 were aggregated into the first mask, termed LoF\\_mis. The second mask, termed HI\\_mis, contained all variants that were predicted either to have a high-impact consequence defined by VEP (transcript ablation, splice acceptor variant, splice donor variant, stop-gain variant, frameshift variant, start/ stop lost variant, and transcript amplification) or to be missense variants with a REVEL score &gt;0.5, a CADD PHRED score &gt;20 or an\n\nM-CAP score &gt;0.025. Only genes with an HGNC symbol that were not read-throughs and that contained more than three QVs in at least one of the masks were kept for testing, resulting in 16,525 analyzed genes. Burden tests were carried out as implemented in the seqMeta R package version 1.6.7 (ref. 74), adjusting for age, sex, ln(eGFR) and the first three genetic principal components as well as serum albumin for plasma metabolites and ln(UACR) for urinary metabolites, respectively . Genotypes were coded as the number of copies of the 2 rare allele (0, 1, 2) on the autosomes and also on the X chromosome for women. For men, genotypes in the non-pseudo-autosomal region of the X chromosome were coded as (0, 2). Statistical significance was defined as nominal significance corrected for the number of tested genes and principal components that explained more than 95% of the metabolites' variance (0.05/16,525/600 = 5.04 \u00d7 10 -9 in plasma, 0.05/16,525/679 = 4.46 \u00d7 10 -9 in urine). For significant gene-metabolite associations, single-variant association tests between each QV in the respective mask and the corresponding metabolite levels were performed under additive modeling, adjusting for the same covariates using the seqMeta R package version 1.6.7 (ref. 74). Sensitivity analyses that evaluated all significant gene-metabolite pairs with regard to additional gene-based tests as well as across strata of sex and kidney function are summarized in the Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5.\n\n## Assessment of QV contributions and driver variants\n\nThe investigation of the genetic architecture underlying gene-metabolite associations and the prioritization of QVs according to their contribution to the gene-based association signal were performed using the forward selection procedure from Bomba et al. 15 . First, for each QV v , the P value Pv is calculated by performing the burden test aggregating all QVs other than v . Second, for each QV v , the difference \u2206  between v Pv and the total P value of the burden test including all QVs is calculated. Subsequently, QVs are ranked by the magnitude of \u2206 . QVs not v contributing to the gene signal or even having an opposite effect can provide a negative \u2206 . Finally, burden tests are performed by adding v the ranked QVs one after the other until the lowest P value is reached, starting with the greatest \u2206 . This identified a set of QVs that contained v only variants that contributed most to the gene-metabolite association signal (that is, led to a stronger association signal) and did not contain variants that introduced noise (that is, neutral variants or those with a small or even opposite effect on metabolite levels). The resulting set of selected variants that led to the lowest possible association P value was designated 'driver variants' for the respective gene-metabolite association. Driver variants within a gene might differ for different associated metabolites.\n\n## Relation of QVs in SLC13A1 and SLC26A1 to musculoskeletal traits\n\nWES and biomedical data of the UKB were used to investigate allelic series of functional QVs in SLC13A1 and SLC26A1 with hypothesized related clinical traits and diseases. We focused on SLC13A1 driver variants with experimental validation or that likely result in a severe consequence (stop-gain, splicing) to select truly functional QVs. Among these, the stop-gain variant encoding p.Arg12*, for which a complete LoF has experimentally been validated 40 , the stop-gain substitution p.Trp48*, for which associations with decreased serum sulfate levels 42 and skeletal phenotypes 41 were reported, and the missense variant encoding p.Arg272Cys, located in a splice region, were available in the UKB. For SLC26A1 , we selected driver QVs for which reduced sulfate transport activity had previously been shown 30 , of which p.Leu384Pro, p.Ser358Leu and p.Thr185Met were available in the UKB. All 6 QVs passed the '90pct10dp' QC filter, defined as at least 90% of all genotypes for a given variant, independent of variant allele zygosity, had a read depth of at least 10 (https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/ukb/ukb/docs/ UKB\\_WES\\_AnalysisBestPractices.pdf).\n\nAnalyses were performed on the UKB Research Analysis Platform. Participants with all ancestries were included into the analysis but excluding strongly related individuals, defined as those that were excluded from the kinship inference process and those with ten or more third-degree relatives. After individual-level filtering, 468,292 individuals remained for analyses. Of these, ten participants were homozygous for one of the six QVs and 7,280 persons were heterozygous for at least one of the QVs. For these homozygous or heterozygous persons, we determined age- and sex-specific   scores of their quantitaz tive anthropometric measurements, enabling interpretation of their measurements compared with noncarriers of the same age and sex. Age- and sex-specific distributions were inverse normal transformed before calculating   scores. z\n\nThe association between each of the six functional QVs with medical diagnoses defined by International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10) codes based on UKB field 41202 (primary or main diagnosis codes across hospital inpatient records) was investigated. We selected musculoskeletal diseases (ICD-10 codes starting with 'M') and fractures and injuries (ICD-10 codes starting with 'S' and containing 'fracture', 'dislocation' or 'sprain' terms). To avoid unreliable estimates, traits were restricted to those with at least two rare variant carriers among both individuals with and without disease. The association was examined using Fisher's exact test under dominant modeling and Firth regression under additive modeling ('brglm2' R package 75 ). We included sex, age at recruitment, sex \u00d7 age and the first 20 genetic principal components (UKB field 22009) as covariates in the regression model. The association with quantitative anthropometric traits was assessed after inverse normal transformation via linear regression, additive genotype modeling and adjusting for the same covariates.\n\n## Gene-based tests for metabolite associations in the UK Biobank\n\nWe performed gene-based tests for significantly associated metabolites available in the UKB to validate our findings using the same settings for analysis as those in our study. Because metabolite levels in the UKB were quantified by Nightingale Health's metabolic biomarker platform focusing on lipids, only two (histidine and phenylalanine) of the 122 significantly associated plasma metabolites were available.\n\nHistidine and phenylalanine values (UKB data fields 23463 and 23468) were inverse normal transformed. Sample and variant QC was performed, and covariates were included as described in the previous paragraph. A total of 260,000 individuals were available for analysis. Association analysis for the two identified gene-metabolite pairs, histidine and HAL as well as phenylalanine and PAH , was performed based on burden tests as implemented in REGENIE version 3.3 in two steps using the HI\\_mis mask, selecting only QVs that were present in the GCKD study to ensure reproducibility of rare variant effects between the studies.\n\n## Setup of the whole-body model and mapping\n\nThe sex-specific and organ-resolved WBM covers 13,543 unique metabolic reactions and 4,140 unique metabolites based on the generic genome-scale reconstruction of human metabolism, Recon3D 23 , and adequate physiological and coupling constraints 22,24 .\n\nOf all observed significant gene-metabolite pairs from the GCKD study, 51 genes and 69 metabolites could be mapped onto Recon3D. For 36 of 51 genes, their associated metabolites could be mapped, resulting in 69 unique gene-metabolite pairs. To investigate perturbations in gene G , we first identified all reactions RG = { r G \u0161 , \u2026 , r Gn } of the corresponding encoded enzymes or transporters in the WBM 76 . We included those genes (27 of 36) in the generation of virtual IEMs that were exclusively causal for a non-empty set of reactions (that is, for a gene G , associated with reactions RG = { r G \u0161 , \u2026 , r Gn } , there did not exist a gene H that was associated with any reaction of RG ) and metabolites with urinary excretion reactions, leading to the exclusion of SLC22A7 and SULT2A1 .\n\n## In silico knockout modeling via linear programming\n\nKnockout simulations were based on maximizing the flux of the excretion or demand reaction of the metabolite of interest M under different conditions in a steady state setting ( Sv = 0 ), where S is the stoichiometric matrix (rows, metabolites; columns, reactions), and v is the flux vector through each reaction, adhering to specific constraints ( vl \u2264 v \u2264 vu ) 22,77 :\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFor simulating a wild-type model for gene G , we solved the linear programming (LP) problem stated in equation (1), choosing the linear objective as the sum of all corresponding fluxes of reactions in RG :\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFirst, we checked whether SG &gt; 10 -6 , a criterion implemented in the function checkIEM\\_WBM of the PSCM toolbox for deciding whether the corresponding reactions could carry any flux 22,78 . All reactions except the TMLHE -associated reactions passed this criterion.\n\nNext, we maximized the flux of two key reactions: the urine excretion reaction (for example, EX M [ u ]) and the created unbounded demand reaction (for example, DM M [ bc ]), designed to reflect accumulation in the blood compartment. First, we unbounded the upper bound of the urine excretion reaction. Next, we maximized the corresponding fluxes of metabolite M as the LP problem stated in equation (1) under the additional constraint that \u2211 = n k \u0161 vGk = SG , providing the maximal urine excretion and the maximal flux into blood given the constraint setting. Finally, to simulate the complete LoF, we blocked all reactions in all organs catalyzed by gene G by setting vG \u0161 = \u2026 = vGn = \u0160 . We derived maximum fluxes as in the wild-type model. Subsequently, we tested whether the knockout resulted in an increase, a decrease or no change in EX M [ u ] and DM M [ bc ] for each mapped gene-metabolite pair that was significant in the GCKD cohort.\n\nFrom the initial 36 genes mapped onto Recon3D, 24 genes and their mapped metabolites fulfilled all criteria (exclusively causal, reactions of the genes carry flux, urinary excretion reaction present), leading to 60 modeled gene-metabolite pairs. After curation of the male and female models, 26 genes ( TMLHE and KYAT1 added) and 67 gene-metabolite pairs could be computed (Supplementary Methods).\n\nLP simulations were carried out in Windows 10 using MATLAB 2021a (MathWorks) as the simulation environment, ILOG CPLEX version 12.9 (IBM) as the LP solver, the COBRA Toolbox version 3.4 (ref. 78) and the PSCM toolbox 22 .\n\n## Microbiome personalization of whole-body models\n\nMicrobiome-personalized WBMs were generated by creating community models based on the genome-scale reconstructions of microbes in the AGORA1 resource 79,80 . Models have been shown to accurately reflect aspects of the fecal host metabolome 80,81 . Briefly, from microbe identification and relative abundance data of a metagenomic sample, genome-scale reconstructions of the identified microbes are joined together and connected via a lumen compartment, where they can exchange metabolites to form a microbial community 82,83 . Each microbial community model is then integrated in the WBM by connecting the microbiota lumen compartment to the large intestinal lumen of the WBM. Microbial community models ( n = 616) were based on publicly available metagenomics data from Yachida et al. 32 and then embedded into the male WBM to form 616 personalized WBMs.\n\n## In silico knockout modeling using quadratic programming\n\nWhile maintaining the same conditions as outlined in equation (1), rather than maximizing a linear objective, we minimized a quadratic objective for each personalized WBM:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, Q is a diagonal matrix, with 10 -6 on its diagonal, a value recommended in the COBRA Toolbox 78 . Because of convexity attributes, equation (3) allows for calculation of a unique flux distribution. For each solution v * , we obtained the corresponding urine excretion reactions of the measured and mapped metabolites. For knockout simulations,  the  associated  reactions  of  gene G were  set  to  zero ( vG \u0161 = \u2026 = vGn = \u0160 ). Then, equation (3) was solved if possible. An optimal quadratic programming (QP) solution could be computed for 582 wild-type models, 590 KYNU -knockout WBMs and 588 PAH -knockout WBMs, which led to 569 paired QPKYNU solutions and 567 paired QPPAH solutions. We analyzed urine secretion fluxes for 257 metabolites covered in the GCKD urine metabolome data and 272 metabolites covered in the GCKD plasma metabolome data that had non-zero flux values. For KYNU , the urine compartment was analyzed, as biomarker quantification for the corresponding IEM is done in urine. Analogously for PAH , the blood metabolome data were analyzed as the clinically relevant compartment. The QP simulations were carried out using the high-performance computing facility, called the Brain-Cluster, of the University of Greifs-wald, employing MATLAB 2019b (MathWorks), ILOG CPLEX version 12.10 (IBM) as the quadratic programming solver and the COBRA Toolbox version 3.4 (ref. 78).\n\n## Statistical analysis of the in silico simulation results\n\nThe Fisher-Freeman-Halton test was used to determine significance when comparing the in vivo and in silico signs from LP modeling. Statistical analysis of the QP solutions was conducted based on the paired wild-type and knockout fluxes via fixed-effect linear regression for panel data 84 . We used ln(urine secretion flux) as the response variable, the knockout status as the sole predictor (wild type versus knockout) and the personalized microbiome as a fixed effect. Significance thresholds were set to 0.05/257 ( KYNU ) and 0.05/272 ( PAH ). Importantly, the entire variance in the regression models had two sources: (1) the knockout and (2) the microbiome personalization. Significance testing of the in silico regression coefficient of the knockout variable therefore delivers a test of whether the knockout explains substantial amounts of variance in comparison to the variance induced by randomly sampled microbiome communities. The in silico regression coefficients were then correlated with the burden-derived observed regression coefficients of genemetabolite associations from the GCKD study, and significance was determined using the standard test for Pearson correlations.\n\n## Experiments on transport activity of SLC6A19\n\nGeneration of cells . Human SLC6A19 (NM\\_001003841.3 \u2192 NP\\_0010 03841.1) and human CLTRN TMEM27 ( ) (NM\\_020665.6 \u2192 NP\\_065716.1) cDNA was synthesized at Life Technologies Gene Art and cloned into a T-REx inducible expression vector. Both vectors were transfected into CHO T-REx cells and selected with neomycin and hygromycin. Mock cells were made by transfecting with only the TMEM27 vector and selection using hygromycin. Stable pools were then selected by measuring doxycycline-inducible uptake of neutral amino acids (for example, isoleucine) by measuring changes in membrane potential using the FLIPR Tetra system. The selected stable cell pools were then serially diluted to generate single-cell clones, which were subsequently selected based on function using the FLIPR assay and hSLC6A19 and hTMEM27 expression using qPCR.\n\nFLIPR membrane potential assay . CHO T-REx cells stably expressing doxycycline-inducible hSLC6A19 and hTMEM27 were seeded in a 384-well plate and incubated overnight with 1 \u00b5g ml -1 doxycycline. The next day, cells were washed and then incubated with Tyrode's buffer (sodium free) with FMP-Blue-Dye, which is a membrane potential dye, for 60 min. The cells were then incubated with standard Tyrode's buffer (130 mM NaCl) with and without cinromide for 10 min before incubation with standard Tyrode's buffer alone or with eight increasing concentrations of methionine sulfone and isoleucine, both with maximum concentrations of 30 mM. The FLIPR Tetra system was used to read FMP-Blue-Dye fluorescence as a measurement of membrane depolarization as a result of substrate-driven electrogenic net influx of Na . Data were analyzed and represented in two ways: (1) for data + comparison with the mock cell line, transport activity was presented as fold over non-substrate-driven signal with the formula (fluorescence signal - median of fluorescence signal with no substrate)/(median of fluorescence signal with no substrate); and (2) for data comparison with cinromide, transport activity was presented as a percent of maximum substrate-driven fluorescence signal with the formula 100 \u00d7 (fluorescence signal - median of fluorescence signal with no substrate)/ (median of fluorescence signal with substrate).\n\n## Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe summary statistics of all significant gene-metabolite associations based on burden tests using two masks as well as all involved QVs with annotations are available in Supplementary Tables 3 and 7, respectively.

Gene-metabolite associations with effect sizes that significantly differ between men and women (P-value &lt; 0.05/128 for plasma or &lt;0.05/107 for urine) are labeled and are exclusively observed for the X-chromosomal TMLHE gene, where hemizygous men show more extreme metabolite levels than heterozygous women.

(a) The bar plot represents the absolute frequency (y-axis) of each of the QVs' consequences with their proportions noted next to them, separately for driver and non-driver variants (x-axis). Whereas driver variants contain more splicing, stop-gain and frameshift variants, the proportion of missense variants is higher among non-driver variants (Fisher's exact test: P-value = 1.3e-6). (b) The swarm plot shows differences in absolute effect sizes for QVs (y-axis) across the five different consequence classes (x-axis). The color reflects the variant status (driver versus non-driver variant). Horizontal lines represent the median of the absolute effect sizes separately for driver and non-driver variants. The median effect of driver variants on metabolite levels increases when ordering the consequence classes with respect to severity (missense, start/stop-lost, frameshift, stop-gain, splicing). (c) The swarm plot shows differences in absolute effect sizes for QVs (y-axis) across groups of variants by minor allele count (MAC) bins (x-axis). Color reflects variant status (driver versus non-driver). Horizontal lines represent the median of the absolute effect sizes separately for driver and non-driver variants. The median effect of driver variants on metabolite levels increases with decreasing MAC bin, supporting that ultra-rare variants tend to have larger effects than those observed more frequently. In case one gene was significantly associated with levels of more than one metabolite, only the QVs from the strongest gene-metabolite associations are included (for only one matrix and only one mask) in each panel, to prevent counting variants multiple times, resulting in 1,885 QVs that were included in each panel.\n\nExtended Data Fig. 5 | Comparison and integration of rare and common variant association signals with metabolite levels within the same locus. under additive modeling (Supplementary Methods), across different cumulative\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(a) The scatter plot shows the absolute effect size (y-axis) of association signals with metabolite levels based on aggregating rare variants within a gene using burden tests and based on the common variant with the lowest significant individual association P-value within the same locus (\u00b1500 kb around the gene) minor allele frequencies (cMAF, for aggregated rare variants) and minor allele frequencies (MAF, for common variants) (x-axis). Colors indicate whether the corresponding association signal is based on shared rare or common variants or whether it is unique to the rare variant screen. The shape represents the matrix of the corresponding metabolite. The absolute effect size tends to increase with decreasing MAF/cMAF. (b) Effect size of 157 gene-metabolite associations with conditioning on associated common variants within the gene region (x-axis) vs. without conditioning on common variants (y-axis) (Supplementary Table 9). Error bars represent the standard errors of the effect sizes. Symbol shape indicates the corresponding matrix. Color reflects the comparison P-value between both analyses, indicating that effect sizes between (un)conditional analyses did not significantly differ for any gene-metabolite association, defined as P-value &lt; 0.05/157.

Urine metabolite levels after inverse normal transformation and covariate-adjustment are shown on the y-axis, among non-carriers and heterozygous and homozygous carriers of QVs in the HI\\_mis mask on the x-axis. Symbol color and shape indicate a variant's carrier status and consequence, respectively. Carriers of multiple heterozygous\n\nQVs are denoted by an asterisk. Boxes range from the 25 th to the 75 th percentile of metabolite levels, the median is indicated by a line, and whiskers end at the last observed value within 1.5*(interquartile range) away from the box. The median levels of ribonate (N = 4,618) (a) , glycocholate (N = 3,753) (b) , and (N(1) + N(8))acetylspermidine (N = 4,619) (c) are all more extreme for the homozygous than the heterozygous carriers, reflecting a dose-response effect.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExtended Data Fig. 7 | Illustration of microbiome-personalized whole-body models of in silico knockout modeling.(a) Generation of whole-body models (WBMs) of human metabolism: Generic reconstructions of human metabolism of Recon3D are used and pruned by organ-specific data and anatomical information, to form differentiated, organ-specific male and female models of human metabolism. The models are derived from Thiele et al. 2020, PMID: 32463598. (b) Identify gene-reaction relations: For each Gene G , it is essential to identify every reaction carried out by the corresponding enzyme/transporter across all organs. The corresponding reactions W\u10bd \u17c6 \u00f7 -\u0161 \u1299\u190c\u1299 \u00f7 -\u00e7 \u17c7 are used for gene-knockout modeling in the linear programming (LP) and quadratic programming (QP) knockout methodologies. (c) Generation of microbiome-personalized whole-body models: Utilizing abundance-data of metagenomic samples, personalized gut microbiome community models are generated via combining the individually present genome-scale reconstructions of microbes in a common lumen compartment. The lumen compartment is then integrated with the whole-body model, thereby creating an individualized host-microbiome model. (d) LP gene-knockout modeling: The system of mass balance equations at steady state, as defined by the stoichiometric matrix S and constraints for each flux, forms a convex space of possible solutions for a vector v of fluxes of a WBM. The sum of fluxes of reactions in RG (expressed as \u10bd \u10bb\u17bf\u10bb ) is maximized, and this maximal value is subsequently\n\n[-\u0110\u0161 \u0110-\u00e7\n\nimposed as a constraint in the wild-type model. Setting all fluxes corresponding to the reactions in RG to zero forms the knockout model. The maximum flux of a biomarker vGM is computed in both models and compared with each other. (e) QP gene-knockout modeling: Each microbiome-personalized whole-body model spans up its individual wild-type solution space under steady state and constraint settings. The solution of the quadratic objective of the flux vector under steady state and constraints for each reaction of the WBM forms the wild-type solution for Harvey/Harvetta, denoted as \u0110 \u192e qa \u10bd \u10be \u0110 \u192e qa \u0161 \u1299 \u11a0 \u17bf\u11a0 \u0110 \u192e qa \u00e7 \u1299 \u10bf . Setting each flux of reaction in RG to zero and repeating the procedure yields the QP solution after knockout, \u0110 \u192e @L . The unique QP solutions across all samples allows for screening for differences within each reaction of the WBM to find possible biomarkers, and for the computation of effect sizes for each reaction.

Three panels are shown for 3-hydroxykynurenine (a) and xanthurenate (b) each: the left panel represents inverse-normal transformed, covariate-adjusted urine levels of the respective metabolite (y-axis) among non-carriers and carriers of QVs in KYNU (x-axis). Units correspond to standard deviations. The boxes range from the 25 th to the 75 th percentile of metabolite levels, the median is indicated by a line, and whiskers end at the last observed value within 1.5*(interquartile range) away from the box. The middle panel represents the distribution of the ln-transformed urinary secretion flux of the respective metabolite in mmol/day into urine (y-axis) from min-norm simulations based on solutions of 569 microbiome-personalized whole-body models without and with simulated knockout of KYNU (x-axis). The right panel shows multiple reaction monitoring (MRM, m/z 225.0 \u2192 162.1, 206.0 \u2192 160.1) chromatograms of the diluted urines of a child with a homozygous, autosomalrecessively inherited loss of KYNU function (patient), the mother and the father. The signals at 3.9 min (3-hydroxykynurenine) and 9.5 min (xanthurenate) are strongly enhanced in the patient sample. Chromatograms are normalized to urine creatinine concentrations; y-axes are normalized to the intensity of the signals in the patient's chromatograms. All three independent approaches arrive at the conclusion that elevated levels of 3-hydroxykynurenine and xanthurenate in urine are a readout of impaired KYNU function.\n\n## pla sma s ul fate* at SLC26A1 (LoF\\_mis)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExtended Data Fig. 9 | Contribution of individual QVs in SLC26A1 to their gene-based association signal with plasma sulfate levels.

Participants were included if they met inclusion criteria, but - as in all epidemiological studies - it cannot be excluded that eligible persons with many or severe comorbidities were less likely to participate than other eligible participants. For this project, all participants with available plasma or urine collected at the baseline visit and with available whole-exome sequencing data were selected (N=4,737).\n\nEthics oversight\n\nThe GCKD Study was registered in the national registry for clinical studies (DRKS 00003971) and approved by all local ethic committees of the nine participating centers (Universities or Medical Faculties of Aachen, Berlin, Erlangen, Freiburg, Hannover, Heidelberg, Jena, M\u00fcnchen, W\u00fcrzburg).\n\nNote that full information on the approval of the study protocol must also be provided in the manuscript.\n\n## Field-specific reporting\n\nPlease select the one below that is the best fit for your research. If you are not sure, read the appropriate sections before making your selection.\n\nLife sciences\n\nBehavioural &amp; social sciences\n\nEcological, evolutionary &amp; environmental sciences\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor a reference copy of the document with all sections, see nature.com/documents/nr-reporting-summary-flat.pdf\n\n## Life sciences study design\n\nAll studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative.\n\nSample size\n\nWe included all 4,737 GCKD participants with available plasma or urine metabolite quantification and with available whole-exome sequencing data. The entire sample was therefore utilized, and no selection was made.\n\nData exclusions\n\nMetabolites were excluded for high proportions of missingness (&gt;93%). Samples were excluded if no high-quality whole-exome sequencing data was available. This is clearly described in the methods.\n\nReplication\n\nReplication of gene-metabolite associations based on aggregating rare damaging variants is difficult because of the non-availability of the same rare damaging variant in an independent cohort.\n\nTherefore, we evaluated reproducibility of our findings by different means :\n\n- We compared our identified gene-metabolite associations to those from 8 published studies that focused on rare variant aggregation testing of metabolite levels. For one published study of the plasma metabolome (based on MS-quantification) that made summary statistics accessible we compared effect sizes on the variant- and gene-level.\n\n- For overlapping metabolites, we conducted gene-based tests in the UKB using the same variants and tests as in our study.\n\n- We investigated the role of our metabolite-associated genes in currently known inborn errors of metabolism (IEM).\n\n- We used whole-body models where in silico gene knockouts were modeled to validate our identified gene-metabolite pairs.\n\n- We performed a proof-of-concept experimental validation study for an implicated metabolite not yet shown to be involved in the encoded protein's function.\n\nWhen information was available, each of these approaches supported the validity of findings.\n\nRandomization\n\nNot relevant to this study because this is an observational study.\n\nBlinding\n\nNot relevant to this study because this is an observational study.\n\n## Reporting for specific materials, systems and methods\n\nWe require information from authors about some types of materials, experimental systems and methods used in many studies. Here, indicate whether each material, system or method listed is relevant to your study. If you are not sure if a list item applies to your research, read the appropriate section before selecting a response.\n\nMaterials &amp; experimental systems\n\nn/a\n\nInvolved in the study\n\nAntibodies\n\nEukaryotic cell lines\n\nPalaeontology and archaeology\n\nAnimals and other organisms\n\nClinical data\n\nDual use research of concern\n\nMethods\n\nn/a\n\nInvolved in the study\n\nChIP-seq\n\nFlow cytometry\n\nMRI-based neuroimaging\n\n## Eukaryotic cell lines\n\nPolicy information about cell lines and Sex and Gender in Research\n\nCell line source(s)\n\nChinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells with Tetracycline-Regulated Expression (T-REx) system.

Non-targeted MS analysis was performed at Metabolon, Inc., from plasma and urine samples collected at the study's baseline visit, as described in detail in the publication.\n\n4"

Proteins and metabolites were integrated using an unsupervised clustering method, and we assessed associations between clusters and CKD progression and kidney failure using Cox proportional hazards models. Analyses were adjusted for demographics and risk factors, including the eGFR and urine protein -creatinine ratio. Associations were identi /uniFB01 ed in a discovery sample (random two thirds, n 5 1139) and then evaluated in a replication sample (one third, n 5 569).\n\nResults We identi /uniFB01 ed 139 modules of correlated proteins and metabolites, which were represented by their principal components. Modules and principal component loadings were projected onto the replication sample, which demonstrated a consistent network structure. Two modules, representing a total of 236 proteins and 82 metabolites, were robustly associated with both CKD progression and kidney failure in both discovery and validation samples. Using gene set enrichment, several transmembrane-related terms were identi /uniFB01 ed as overrepresented in these modules. Transmembrane -ephrin receptor activity displayed the largest odds (odds ratio 5 13.2, P value 5 5.5 3 10 2 5 ). A module containing CRIM1 and NPNT expressed in podocytes demonstrated particularly strong associations with kidney failure ( P value 5 2.6 3 10 2 5 ).\n\nConclusions This study demonstrates that integration of the proteome and metabolome can identify functions of pathophysiologic importance in kidney disease.\n\nJASN 35: 923 -935, 2024. doi: https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.0000000000000343\n\nThis is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

This condition is associated with a heightened risk of various medical complications, including cardiovascular disease, bone and metabolic disorders, and frailty. 1 3 -A better understanding of the intricate relationship between the human proteome and metabolome in CKD may facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers for early-stage risk prediction and shed light on underlying pathways, potentially illuminating new targets for personalized treatment\n\nDue to the number of contributing authors, the affiliations are listed at the end of this article.\n\nCorrespondence: Dr. Pascal Schlosser, email: pascal.schlosser@uniklinik-freiburg.de\n\nReceived: December 6, 2023 Accepted: April 1, 2024 Published Online Ahead of Print: April 19, 2024\n\napproaches that enhance the management of CKD and kidney failure. 4\n\nThe human proteome and metabolome are interconnected, and these connections are vital for the proper functioning of the body. Together, they represent the summative effects of genes, environment, age, comorbidities, behaviors, and medications on overall health. 5,6 Proteins serve many biological roles, including as enzymes and molecular transporters. Metabolites, which represent intermediates or end-products of these protein-driven reactions, play a central role in energy generation and maintenance of a stable internal environment (homeostasis). Metabolites are also derived from external exposures such as diet or the gut microbiome. Both protein and metabolite concentrations are tightly regulated at various steps, including production, transport between different compartments, breakdown, and excretion. 7 10 -When examining comprehensive pro /uniFB01 les of circulating metabolites and proteins, it is evident that many of them are highly correlated. 11,12\n\nStudies in CKD to date have focused on proteins or metabolites separately. Several proteomic analyses have highlighted the association of the TNF signaling pathway with the progression of kidney disease in various cohorts, with particular emphasis on TNF receptor superfamily members 1a (TNFRSF1A) and TNFRSF1B. 13 15 -Furthermore, researchers identi /uniFB01 ed a signature of circulating proteins involved in in /uniFB02 ammation that was associated with the subsequent development of kidney failure. 16 In recent comprehensive screens, Grams et al. 17 and Dubin et al. 18 studied . 4500 proteins each across three cohorts and identi /uniFB01 ed dozens of distinct proteins associated with the risk of kidney function decline. Rhee et al. 19 identi /uniFB01 ed 16 metabolites that predicted incident CKD in the Framingham Heart Study, and Sekula et al. 20 identi /uniFB01 ed metabolomic markers of eGFR, incident CKD, and incident kidney failure. Wen et al. 21 in a metabolomic analysis highlighted potential markers of glomerular /uniFB01 ltration, carbamylation, and tubular function that were associated with CKD progression in three different cohorts. Similarly, Steinbrenner et al. 22 discovered eight metabolites whose concentrations in urine were found to be associated with kidney failure.\n\nTo better understand the early changes in disease processes, an integrated assessment of metabolomic and proteomic platforms together allows for an investigation of altered pathways rather than isolated molecular reactions. 11,23,24 An integrated approach is particularly relevant in the study of kidney disease because kidney function and its decline over time are related to many proteins and metabolites. The emerging associations from analyses of individual molecules have repeatedly implicated multiple molecules within the same pathways. 17,23,25 27 -In this study (see /uniFB02 ow chart in Supplemental Figure 1), we used a data-driven approach to identify pathways (referred to as modules) on the basis of circulating proteins and metabolites in the Chronic Renal Insuf /uniFB01 ciency Cohort (CRIC) study. 28 We /uniFB01 rst split our sample in a discovery and replication dataset to enable internal replication. We then used a dimension reduction technique called Netboost, which uses network analysis principles and has previously been shown to outperform other correlation-based approaches. 29 In this method, proteins and metabolites are organized into modules on the basis of their Spearman correlation, and the module information is then quanti /uniFB01 ed using principal component (PC) analysis. Hence, we were able to assess module-wise effects re /uniFB02 ecting the whole pathway rather than individual components and characterized these modules in terms of their relevance to kidney function decline and kidney failure.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Study Population\n\nThe purpose of the CRIC study was to examine the factors that contribute to the progression of CKD, cardiovascular disease, and overall mortality among individuals with CKD. 28 From 2003 to 2008, the CRIC study successfully recruited 3939 participants, aged 21 -74 years, with an eGFR between 20 and 70 ml/min per 1.73 m . 28 2 The study was conducted across seven clinical centers. Detailed information regarding the eligibility criteria and baseline characteristics of the cohort has been published. 28,30 In this analysis, we examined plasma samples from the year 1 visit of the CRIC study, which served as the baseline for our research. A random subsample of 1800 participants from the CRIC study was selected for metabolomic pro /uniFB01 ling; all year 1 participants with available samples underwent proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling. 31 For our study, we included individuals whose samples passed quality control assurance for both metabolomic and proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling ( N 5 1708). The /uniFB01 nal analytical cohort was split randomly into discovery (two thirds) and replication (one third) datasets.\n\n## Study Outcomes\n\nThe eGFR was calculated using the CRIC study equation, which uses both serum creatinine and cystatin C levels to estimate GFR measured by iothalamate. 32 The primary outcomes of interest in the study were time to kidney failure (de /uniFB01 ned as the need for KRT, i.e ., dialysis or transplant) and time to CKD progression (de /uniFB01 ned as the /uniFB01 rst occurrence of a decline in eGFR of $ 50% or incident kidney failure). The censoring date for follow-up was January 2019.\n\n## Proteomic Profiling\n\nWithin the CRIC study, a total of 5284 plasma protein aptamers were quanti /uniFB01 ed in the participants using the SomaScan platform v4, which uses a Slow Off-rate Modi/uniFB01 ed Aptamer-based capture array. The Adaptive Normalization by Maximum Likelihood technique used by SomaLogic was used to standardize the protein dataset, decreasing assay biases. To address the skewed distribution of raw values, the protein values were log2 transformed. In addition, any values beyond 5 SDs on the log2 scale were winsorized. Furthermore, certain aptamers were excluded from the analysis if the Bland -Altman coef /uniFB01 cient of variation exceeded 0.5 among 92 blind duplicate samples or if they were /uniFB02 agged by SomaLogic quality control. The /uniFB01 nal analysis focused exclusively on human proteins, resulting in a total of 4091 aptamers included in the study.\n\n## Metabolomic Profiling\n\nThe comprehensive procedures of the Broad Institute metabolomics methods, which encompass quality control aspects,\n\nhave been published. 31,33 In the year 1 visit plasma, a combination of three liquid chromatography -mass spectrometry injections was used to analyze metabolites. Different methods were used on the basis of the charge and polarity of the analytes. The raw metabolomics data were processed using TraceFinder (Thermo Fisher Scienti /uniFB01 c) and Progenesis QI (Nonlinear Dynamics), and metabolite peaks were identi /uniFB01 ed by comparing retention times and masses to reference mixtures and an internal database of over 600 compounds.\n\nIn the data preprocessing phase, several steps were taken to ensure the quality and suitability of the metabolite data. Samples that had more than 50% missing values across all metabolites were excluded. In addition, endogenous and unnamed metabolites that had more than 80% missing values were excluded from analysis. Imputation of missing values was performed using the minimum observed value (2.9% of metabolite values). Metabolite values were rescaled to have a median value of 1 and log2 transformed. Then, metabolites with a variance below 0.01 were removed from the analysis. Finally, to mitigate the in /uniFB02 uence of extreme values on subsequent analyses, any metabolite values that fell outside the range of 6 5 SDs from the mean were winsorized at those respective limits. The /uniFB01 nal dataset contained 630 metabolites.\n\n## Module Formation\n\nNetboost, an unsupervised three-step dimension reduction technique, was used in this study (Bioconductor R package, Netboost v2.10). 29 The process involves /uniFB01 ltering variable pairs to construct a sparse correlation-based network with strong edges. Variables are then hierarchically clustered into modules on the basis of this network, and moduleaggregated measures are quanti /uniFB01 ed using the robust PCs of each module. Netboost was used to characterize modules using combined proteomic and metabolomic data similar to a previous study on overall mortality. 24 The minimal module size was set to /uniFB01 ve, and distance measures were determined on the basis of Spearman coef /uniFB01 cients with a soft power coef /uniFB01 cient of three (default). To reduce dimensionality, highly correlated preface modules, de /uniFB01 ned as modules with a correlation of the /uniFB01 rst PCs . 0.9, were merged. Each module thus contains a unique set of proteins and metabolites. Modules were quanti /uniFB01 ed using three PCs or fewer if they already explained at least 50% of the module variance. The unsupervised Netboost procedure was /uniFB01 tted on the discovery dataset and module membership and PC loadings were transferred to the replication dataset.\n\n## Characterization of Modules and Association with Kidney Disease Progression\n\nTo characterize the identi /uniFB01 ed modules of proteins and metabolites, we regressed module PCs on various clinical traits. These traits included age, sex, eGFR, urine protein -creatinine ratio (UPCR), HDL, body mass index (BMI), serum albumin, diabetes status, and hypertension status. The UPCR was determined from a 24-hour urine collection and naturally log-transformed. Diabetes status was de /uniFB01 ned on the basis of self-reported use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications, fasting blood glucose levels $ 126 mg/dl, nonfasting blood glucose levels $ 200 mg/dl, or an HbA1c level $ 6.5%. Hypertension status was de /uniFB01 ned on the basis of self-reported antihypertensive medication use, systolic BP $ 140 mm Hg, or diastolic BP $ 90 mm Hg.\n\nSubsequently, we examined the associations between module PCs and the risk of kidney failure and CKD progression using Cox proportional hazards models. To account for potential confounders, the analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race, eGFR, ln(UPCR), HDL, serum albumin, BMI, diabetes status, and hypertension status. 34 -37 Effect sizes are reported in SD units on the basis of the discovery sample. Illustrating the bimodal distribution of a module PC, we strati /uniFB01 ed the module PC at the local minimum for the Kaplan -Meier graphs.\n\nFor each replicated module PC association, we performed the same analysis for the three proteins and three metabolites that were most strongly related to the module PCs on the basis of rank-normalized data (Spearman correlation coef /uniFB01 cient).\n\nHarrell s C-index, 38 ' as a measure of model performance, was assessed using the R package survival version 3.5 -5 39 for both clinical covariate -only models and the models incorporating both clinical covariates and module PCs. Only the independent replication set was used to assess the models ' performance and whether the module PCs improved Harrell s C-index. Replication analyses and tests ' for improvement were conducted in a one-sided manner. All other statistical tests were performed using two-sided approaches, and signi /uniFB01 cance levels were adjusted using Bonferroni correction to account for the number of module PCs tested.\n\n## Enrichment Analyses\n\nTo investigate pathways underlying the modules, we evaluated for enrichment of the metabolite super-pathways (amino acid, carbohydrate, cofactors and vitamins, lipid, nucleotide, organic acids and derivatives, organic nitrogen compounds, organoheterocyclic compounds, Xenobiotics) and subpathways using a one-tailed Fisher s exact test. In ' addition, we assessed the enrichment of proteins within the identi /uniFB01 ed module in terms of gene ontology terms. Only terms with at least three components that were measured were included in enrichment testing.\n\nEnrichment analyses were conducted using the clusterPro /uniFB01 ler R package v4.6.2. 40 To account for multiple testing, we used the Benjamini -Hochberg (BH) adjustment method, which controls the false discovery rate at a threshold of , 0.05. 41\n\n## Kidney Gene Expression Profiles\n\nTo localize gene expression within the kidney, we used the public domain data from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) as provided in the Kidney Tissue Atlas (https://atlas.kpmp.org/) 42 and extracted through the NephGen scExplorer (https://nephgen.imbi.uni-freiburg. de). We used the regional transcriptomics dataset ( N 5 36) to perform a Wilcoxon rank sum test for differences in regions (glomerulus, interstitium, thick ascending limb, collecting duct, proximal tubule, and distal convoluted tubule). The single-nucleus RNA sequencing data ( N 5 29) were used to test for differences in kidney cell subclasses. Experimental setup and cell type identi /uniFB01 cation were described by Lake et al. 42\n\nTable 1.

For each protein, we obtained all available clinical precedence for drugs targeting respective proteincoding gene. For each metabolite, we obtained all available evidence on the utilization of the respective molecule as a pharmaceutical agent.\n\n## Ethics Approval and Consent to Participate\n\nThe CRIC study obtained written informed consent from all participants and followed the ethical guidelines outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. In addition, it received approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Human samples collected as part of the KPMP consortium (https://KPMP.org) were obtained with informed consent and approved under a protocol by the KPMP single IRB of the University of Washington IRB (20190213).\n\n## Results\n\n## CRIC Study Population Characteristics\n\nThe discovery and replication samples displayed comparable distributions for all covariables included in the analysis (Table 1).\n\n## Integrated Omics Module Formation and Characterization\n\nThe 4091 proteins and 630 metabolites (Supplemental Table 1) were clustered into 139 nonoverlapping modules in the discovery data (Figure 1A). There were 154 proteins and 37 metabolites that did not cluster with sets of at least /uniFB01 ve molecules and remained unassigned. The mean module size was 32.6 proteins or metabolites; 69 modules consisted exclusively of proteins, 28 modules consisted exclusively of metabolites, and 42 modules were a combination of proteins and metabolites. There were 286 PCs used to represent the 139 modules (Methods).\n\nThe network structure was consistently recovered in the replication data (Figure 1B; Spearman correlation coef /uniFB01 cient 5 0.99, P value , 1.0 3 10 2 320 ). Modules consisting solely of metabolites or proteins displayed tighter correlation structures than mixed modules (replication sample PC1, mean Spearman correlations coef /uniFB01 cients: metabolites-only modules 5 0.81, protein-only modules 5 0.57, mixed modules 5 0.46), which aligned with the average degrees of these module types (mean degree across module types: metabolites only 5 12.0, protein only 5 26.0, mixed 5 60.3).\n\nModule PCs were related to clinical variables, demonstrating that many modules re /uniFB02 ect a speci /uniFB01 c phenotype (Supplemental Table 2). For example, 74% of the variance in the /uniFB01 rst PC of module 106 was explained by sex, which is consistent with many of the protein components being involved in sex hormone pathways ( e.g ., the luteinizing hormone and the follicle-stimulating hormone). The eGFR explained 78% of the variance of PC1 of module 15 (Figure 1C), which included creatinine and cystatin C among other proteins/metabolites that are known biomarkers of kidney /uniFB01 ltration (Supplemental Table 2), as well as more than 50% of an additional six module representations, all of which consisted of proteins and metabolites but one protein-only module. PC1 of module 15 was additionally the most strongly related module with UPCR (31% of variance explained). HDL was strongly related to module 122 -a cluster of plasmalogen metabolites (explained variance 30%). Serum albumin explained, at most, 14% of module representations.\n\n## Associations of Modules with Kidney Disease Progression\n\nThere were 537 kidney failure and 685 CKD progression events over an average follow-up of 9.5 (max. 15.5) and 7.4 (max. 15.5) years, respectively. There were 13 signi /uniFB01 cant module PC end point associations (four CKD progression; -nine kidney failure) in the discovery dataset (Table 2) in a comprehensively adjusted model ( P , 0.05/286; Methods; Supplemental Table 3) that were moved forward for replication. Twelve of the associations were direction consistent and four were validated in the replication dataset ( P , 0.05/#discovery associations, direction consistent) (Table 2): PC1 of module 15 was associated with CKD progression and kidney failure and PC2 of module 48 with CKD progression and kidney failure. All associations included adjustment for eGFR and UPCR among eight additional covariables (Methods).\n\n## Kidney Disease Progression Characterized by Transmembrane-Ephrin Receptor Activity and Amino Acid Module\n\nThe strongest association between a module and outcome was for module 15 PC1 and kidney failure (Table 2; kidney failure hazard ratio discovery 2.37 [95% con/uniFB01 dence interval, 1.69 to 3.33], replication 1.82 [95% con /uniFB01 dence interval, 1.19 to 2.79]). Module 15 included 82 metabolites and 214 proteins with a strong group\n\nFigure 1. Data-driven proteomic and metabolomic modules display a consistent network structure and relate to clinical characteristics. (A) Dendrogram of the 4091 proteins and 630 metabolites quantified in the CRIC study. In total, 139 modules (upper colored bar) were detected. Individual proteins and metabolites are depicted as the individual dendrogram leaves (lower colored bar: cyan 5 protein, red 5 metabolite), and height represents the pairwise dissimilarity of the topological overlap on the basis of the sparse correlation network. (B) Modules were detected in the discovery sample and transferred to the replication sample. The scatterplot shows the transferability of the module correlation, as expressed by the Spearman correlation coefficient of components with the PCs, from discovery to replication. The overall Spearman correlation coefficient is 0.99 ( P value , 1.0 3 10 2 320 ). The modules significantly associated with CKD progression and kidney failure are labeled (module 15: discovery 5 0.63, replication 5 0.64, module 48: discovery 5 0.48, replication 5 0.46). (C) The PC1 of module 15 displayed the strongest relation to eGFR and the strongest relation to UPCR of all module PCs.

PC1 summarized 42.7% of the variation in the 296 molecules. Central hub components of the module were NBL1, TNFRSF1A, ROR2, SELM, GM2A, and EFNA4\n\n(Spearman correlation with PC1 . 0.92). When screening the top three proteins and top three metabolites most strongly associated with module 15 PC1 (Supplemental Table 3), TNFRSF1A provided marginally stronger associations for kidney failure than the corresponding module 15\n\nTable 2.

Association of kidney failure (B) and progression (C) with module 15 PC1 distribution: The Kaplan-Meier graphs demonstrate the association between end points and the module PC stratified at the central local minimum in the PC1 distribution (minimum is agnostic of end point status; kidney failure log-rank P value 5 5.2 3 10 2 152 ; progression log-rank P value 5 6.2 3 10 2 148 ).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPC1 in the discovery sample ( P valueTNFRSF1A 5 2.2 3 10 2 7 , P valuem15pc1 5 5.9 3 10 2 7 ). In all other cases, the module PCs provided stronger associations (lower P values) than any of the individual molecules in discovery and replication (Supplemental Table 4).\n\nprogression (log-rank P value 5 6.2 3 10 2 148 , Figure 2C) was emphasized.\n\nNotably, only nine of 296 components translated into a protective PC1 effect for kidney failure, with all /uniFB01 ve protective proteins being transmembrane proteins (proteins: ATF6A, Alcadein a -1, ERBB1, and growth hormone receptor, C1GLC; metabolites: a 2 ketoisovalerate, myristoleate, homoarginine, and trimethylbenzene). PC2 separated the metabolomic and proteomic components of module 15 (Figure 2A). The distribution of PC1 was bimodal, and when stratifying samples by the local minimum (0.35; agnostic of case -control status), the association with kidney failure (log-rank P value 5 5.2 3 10 2 152 , Figure 2B) and\n\nThree super and subpathways were overrepresented among metabolites in module 15 (BH-adjusted P value , 0.05; Supplemental Table 5). For amino acids, carbohydrate, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and pyruvate metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and histidine metabolism, module 15 even included $ 50% of the annotated metabolites on the platform. Twelve gene ontology terms were overrepresented among proteins in module 15 (Supplemental Table 6), and transmembrane -ephrin receptor activity displayed the largest odds ratio (OR) among these (OR 5 13.2, BH P value 5 0.0047). The four ephrins in module 15 were among the core components of the disease-associated PC1, demonstrating strong correlations with PC1 (Supplemental Table 3;\n\nSpearman correlation coef /uniFB01 cient with PC1: EFNA4 5 0.92; EFNB2 5 0.91; EFNA5 5 0.91; EFNA2 5 0.89), with the /uniFB01 ve ephrin receptors also strongly related (Spearman correlation coef /uniFB01 cient with PC1: EPHB6 5 0.76; EPHA5 5 0.67; EPHB1 5 0.67; EPHB2 5 0.52; EPHA1 5 0.49).\n\n## Kidney Disease Progression Characterized by a PodocyteRelated Module\n\nModule 48 consisted of 22 proteins, and the second PC summarized 6.9% of the variation. Module 48 PC2 provided stronger statistical inference than any of the top three proteins (Supplemental Tables 3 and 4) in discovery or replication. It was furthermore signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with /uniFB01 ve patient characteristics: diabetes ( P value 5 6.78e-15), hypertension ( P value 5 2.62e-06), serum albumin ( P value 5 2.10e-18), UPCR ( P value 5 7.47e-33), and eGFR ( P value 5 2.53e-89). In kidney tissue, CRIM1 and NPNT emerged as the two encoding genes exhibiting the highest expression levels (Figure 3A). Notably, CRIM1 was identi /uniFB01 ed as the protein exhibiting the closest relationship to PC2 (Supplemental Table 3). Regional transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing show that both CRIM1 and NPNT are primarily expressed in the glomerulus ( CRIM1 : fold change 5 1.4, P value 5 7.4 3 10 2 6 ; NPNT : fold change 5 1.7, P value 5 1.3 3 10 2 3 ) and speci /uniFB01 cally in (degenerative) podocytes (Figure 3, B and C; CRIM1 : log fold change 5 2.9, P value 5 1.8 3 10 2 38 ; NPNT : log fold change 5 3.6, P value 5 1.1 3 10 2 73 ).\n\n## Risk Prediction Models for CKD Progression and Kidney Failure Improved by Podocyte-Related Module\n\nWe developed a model in the discovery dataset for each outcome consisting of the ten clinical covariates, and one model additionally adjusting for the replicated modules, and evaluated their predictive performance in the replication sample (Table 3). Discrimination of the model was signi /uniFB01 cantly better with the addition of each module for CKD progression and for module 48 PC2 for kidney failure. The highest C-statistic was achieved for the model incorporating both module PCs.\n\n## Drug Targets of Identified Components\n\nTo study the repurposing potential of the identi /uniFB01 ed pathways, we queried all components of modules 15 and 48 for ongoing and past clinical trials targeting the proteins or using the metabolites. Of the 209 unique proteins in module 15, 34 were annotated in the database (Supplemental Table 7). After exclusion of trials with status terminated or withdrawn, 160 drugs that are studied in the context of 2426 protein -drug disease combina--tions were identi /uniFB01 ed. This was driven by extensive research on some components (all with . 100 combinations: 702 EGFR, 363 VAGFA, 357 CD274, 214 MAP2K2, 147 IL2RB). Among the ephrins, an Ephrin-B2 inhibitor (CHEMBL4298079) is currently under phase 1 and 2 investigation for various cancers (bladder transitional cell carcinoma, urinary bladder carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, prostate cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, Kaposi sarcoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma). An ephrin receptor inhibitor (CHEMBL24828) was /uniFB01 rst approved as VANDETANIB in 2011 and has seven approved (all cancers) and 41 investigational indications. Of the 22 unique proteins in module 48, three were annotated (Supplemental Table 8). TFRC, TNFRSF10B, and TXN were targeted by nine unique drugs (one drug terminated in all trials). Among the 80 unique module 15 metabolites, 11 were annotated, of which seven were used in clinical trials, including two approved drugs -allopurinol and sorbitol (Supplemental Table 9).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis study aimed to explore the intricate relationship between metabolites and proteins and their association with kidney disease. Despite the importance of their myriad interactions -in their roles as substrates and enzymes, in allosteric interactions, and the assembly of protein complexes -few studies have simultaneously evaluated the proteome and metabolome. Recently, we identi /uniFB01 ed several mortality-associated modules of proteins and metabolites that related to diabetes/insulin secretion, cardiovascular disease, and kidney function. 24 In this study, we now integrated proteomic and metabolomic data into correlation-driven modules, projected them into a replication sample, investigated their association with kidney failure and CKD progression, and identi /uniFB01 ed ephrin- and podocyte-related modules that are associated with kidney disease.\n\nModule 15, the module displaying the strongest end point associations, was driven by many proteomic and metabolomic components, highlighting the utility of combining multiple sources of omics data. Enrichment analyses revealed transmembrane -ephrin receptor activity as a key driver of kidney disease progression and kidney failure. This /uniFB01 nding aligns with a previous study by Kiernan et al. 44 that implicated proteins in the ephrin superfamily with albuminuria, including a putatively causal association with EFNA4 -the most central module 15 PC1 ephrin component. Satake et al. 45 found several ephrin ligands and receptors as downstream targets of a comprehensive miRNA screen in patients with diabetic kidney disease with particularly robust independent effects for EPHA2 and EFNA4. Recently, a proteomic screen in the CRIC study with replication in ARIC also identi /uniFB01 ed the ephrin family and ephrin signaling among the top signals for a higher risk of CKD progression. 18 Early genetic studies investigated the relation of EFNB2 and kidney failure in 1071 Black patients, 46 and haplotype-based analysis reached nominal signi /uniFB01 cance ( P value 5 0.03) in the limited sample size. The ephrin-B2 receptor has been linked to kidney /uniFB01 brosis, 47 and a dedicated look-up of ephrins in our recent screen of the effects of proteins on kidney function 27 showed additional putatively causal associations for the Ephrin type A receptor 2 on albuminuria and eGFR ( P 5 6.6 3 10 2 4 , P 5 4.2 3 10 2 3 ) and for Ephrin type B receptor 1 on eGFR ( P 5 4.5 3 10 2 3 ; P , 0.05/11 ephrins). In this study, the association between the ephrin superfamily enriched module and kidney disease progression persisted even after adjusting for UPCR, indicating its independent predictive value. The analysis of drug targets revealed several ephrin-related inhibitors already under clinical investigation in the context of cancer.

In a comprehensive investigation across the proteome within the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, 15 aptamers exhibited a signi /uniFB01 cant association with eGFR decline by 50% or kidney failure. 17 Notably, 12 of the 15 aptamers were components of module 15, including NBL1, the neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1, and the most central component of this module (Spearman correlation of 0.94), which has also been independently implicated with risk of kidney failure in individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. 48 Module 15 was further enriched for members of the tryptophan pathway (enrichment OR 5 7.2; P value 5 1.8 3 10 2 3 ). Tryptophan has been highlighted in multiple previous studies using different study populations and metabolomic platforms. 21,22,49 -53 Furthermore, the link of protein and metabolite components of module 15 is supported by a recent study by Steiner et al. 54 They identi /uniFB01 ed a novel mutation of the TNFRSF1A gene, which encodes\n\nTable 3.

In the affected individuals, both the tryptophan metabolism ( P value 5 1.5 3 10 2 12 ) and histidine metabolism ( P value 5 8.9 3 10 2 6 ) were differentially regulated compared with healthy controls, coinciding with the two enriched amino acid subpathways in module 15. 54\n\nTo encompass secondary or tertiary biological functions of the data-driven pathways de /uniFB01 ning a module, we incorporated the second and third PCs for modules where the /uniFB01 rst PC explained , 50% of the variance. Indeed, module 48 PC2 showed a protective association with kidney failure and CKD progression. The central component protein, CRIM1, is a cell-surface, transmembrane protein that binds to a variety of growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor A. 55 Although the studied proteins were derived from circulating levels, the expression pro /uniFB01 les of proteins within module 48 in kidney tissue are interesting. The two most strongly expressed genes were CRIM1 and NPNT , both were speci /uniFB01 cally expressed extracellular matrix proteins in podocytes, 56 and the glomerular disease -relevant micro-RNA miR-378a-3p may target both NPNT and vascular endothelial growth factor A . 57 An quantitative UPCR study localized CRIM1 in the slit diaphragm of glomerular podocytes, 58 and immunolocalization and in situ hybridization studies in mouse kidneys demonstrated podocyte production of NPNT and deposition into the glomerular basement membrane. 59\n\nA Crim1 hypomorphic transgenic mouse developed glomerular cysts and severe glomerular vascular defects, followed by glomerular capillary defects, reduced GFR, and progressive interstitial /uniFB01 brosis. 60 Furthermore, a decrease in the NPNT expression level in zebra /uniFB01 sh induced podocyte injury. 57 A genomewide association study in Australian Aboriginal populations identi /uniFB01 ed a signi /uniFB01 cant association at CRIM1 for the albumin-to-creatinine ratio. 61,62 Taken together, these /uniFB01 ndings highlight a potential role for CRIM1 and NPNT in glomerular basement membrane and endothelial maintenance and integrity with relevance to disease progression.\n\nAnother notable /uniFB01 nding was the stability of the proteomic and metabolomic network structure. The modules identi /uniFB01 ed in the discovery set showed near-identical correlation structures in the replication data. Modules formed with metabolites alone had the strongest intranetwork correlations, suggesting strong master regulation and the potential utility of a clustering approach to the evaluation of metabolite -outcome associations. Interestingly, different types of modules (metabolite-only versus protein-only versus mixed proteins and metabolites) showed different in /uniFB02 uences of clinical characteristics. Among nine clinical characteristics, six (eGFR, UPCR, serum albumin, age, BMI, and hypertension) exerted the largest explained variance in relation to a mixed module, emphasizing the utility of the integrated analytical approach. For HDL, a speci /uniFB01 c plasmalogen metabolite module displayed the strongest characterization, and for sex and diabetes status, two protein-only modules were the top associations.\n\nThe study s major strengths included the use of network ' methods to integrate proteins and metabolites, the welldesigned CRIC cohort with long follow-up, and extensive metabolomics and proteomics panels. In addition, we used an internal replication design to validate our /uniFB01 ndings. The use of unsupervised rank-based network abstraction helped identify data-driven pathways and reduce the burden of multiple testing and presents a complementary view on kidney pathophysiology to analyses of individual molecules. However, the study also had some limitations. The used Netboost approach, like other correlation-based methods, does not establish causal relationships between variables. Module membership might be confounded by external in /uniFB02 uences, where the observed associations might be downstream of a common cause. While our analytic design is inherently associative and does not resolve causal directions, the stability of the network structure observed in the independent replication sample speaks to the robustness of the approach to generate physiological hypotheses at the pathway level that go beyond what is observed with a one-molecule-at-a-time approach. Because these conclusions are related to the comprehensive but costly combination of the SomaScan proteomics and Broad Institute metabolomics platforms, the study relied on internal replication, and the improvements in risk prediction were modest; our study is not intended to establish new clinical routines, but rather to provide insight into the pathophysiology of disease progression.\n\nIn conclusion, this study successfully demonstrated that the integration of the proteome and metabolome can identify molecules related to CKD progression. The clustering technique used sheds light on the combined effects of correlated proteins and metabolites on adverse health outcomes, complementing established risk factors. Ephrin transmembrane proteins and the podocyte-expressed CRIM1 and NPNT emerged as central components driving the observed associations and warrant further experimental and clinical investigation.\n\n## Disclosures\n\nDisclosure forms, as provided by each author, are available with the online version of the article at http://links.lww.com/ JSN/E629.\n\n## Funding\n\nFunding for the CRIC study was obtained under a cooperative agreement from National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (U01DK060990, U01DK060984, U01DK061022, U01DK061021, U01DK061028, U01DK060980, U01DK060963, U01DK060902, and U24DK060990).

Proteins and metabolites were integrated using an unsupervised clustering method, and we assessed associations between clusters and CKD progression and kidney failure using Cox proportional hazards models. Analyses were adjusted for demographics and risk factors, including the eGFR and urine protein -creatinine ratio. Associations were identi /uniFB01 ed in a discovery sample (random two thirds, n 5 1139) and then evaluated in a replication sample (one third, n 5 569).\n\nResults We identi /uniFB01 ed 139 modules of correlated proteins and metabolites, which were represented by their principal components. Modules and principal component loadings were projected onto the replication sample, which demonstrated a consistent network structure. Two modules, representing a total of 236 proteins and 82 metabolites, were robustly associated with both CKD progression and kidney failure in both discovery and validation samples. Using gene set enrichment, several transmembrane-related terms were identi /uniFB01 ed as overrepresented in these modules. Transmembrane -ephrin receptor activity displayed the largest odds (odds ratio 5 13.2, P value 5 5.5 3 10 2 5 ). A module containing CRIM1 and NPNT expressed in podocytes demonstrated particularly strong associations with kidney failure ( P value 5 2.6 3 10 2 5 ).\n\nConclusions This study demonstrates that integration of the proteome and metabolome can identify functions of pathophysiologic importance in kidney disease.\n\nJASN 35: 923 -935, 2024. doi: https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.0000000000000343\n\nThis is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

This condition is associated with a heightened risk of various medical complications, including cardiovascular disease, bone and metabolic disorders, and frailty. 1 3 -A better understanding of the intricate relationship between the human proteome and metabolome in CKD may facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers for early-stage risk prediction and shed light on underlying pathways, potentially illuminating new targets for personalized treatment\n\nDue to the number of contributing authors, the affiliations are listed at the end of this article.\n\nCorrespondence: Dr. Pascal Schlosser, email: pascal.schlosser@uniklinik-freiburg.de\n\nReceived: December 6, 2023 Accepted: April 1, 2024 Published Online Ahead of Print: April 19, 2024\n\napproaches that enhance the management of CKD and kidney failure. 4\n\nThe human proteome and metabolome are interconnected, and these connections are vital for the proper functioning of the body. Together, they represent the summative effects of genes, environment, age, comorbidities, behaviors, and medications on overall health. 5,6 Proteins serve many biological roles, including as enzymes and molecular transporters. Metabolites, which represent intermediates or end-products of these protein-driven reactions, play a central role in energy generation and maintenance of a stable internal environment (homeostasis). Metabolites are also derived from external exposures such as diet or the gut microbiome. Both protein and metabolite concentrations are tightly regulated at various steps, including production, transport between different compartments, breakdown, and excretion. 7 10 -When examining comprehensive pro /uniFB01 les of circulating metabolites and proteins, it is evident that many of them are highly correlated. 11,12\n\nStudies in CKD to date have focused on proteins or metabolites separately. Several proteomic analyses have highlighted the association of the TNF signaling pathway with the progression of kidney disease in various cohorts, with particular emphasis on TNF receptor superfamily members 1a (TNFRSF1A) and TNFRSF1B. 13 15 -Furthermore, researchers identi /uniFB01 ed a signature of circulating proteins involved in in /uniFB02 ammation that was associated with the subsequent development of kidney failure. 16 In recent comprehensive screens, Grams et al. 17 and Dubin et al. 18 studied . 4500 proteins each across three cohorts and identi /uniFB01 ed dozens of distinct proteins associated with the risk of kidney function decline. Rhee et al. 19 identi /uniFB01 ed 16 metabolites that predicted incident CKD in the Framingham Heart Study, and Sekula et al. 20 identi /uniFB01 ed metabolomic markers of eGFR, incident CKD, and incident kidney failure. Wen et al. 21 in a metabolomic analysis highlighted potential markers of glomerular /uniFB01 ltration, carbamylation, and tubular function that were associated with CKD progression in three different cohorts. Similarly, Steinbrenner et al. 22 discovered eight metabolites whose concentrations in urine were found to be associated with kidney failure.\n\nTo better understand the early changes in disease processes, an integrated assessment of metabolomic and proteomic platforms together allows for an investigation of altered pathways rather than isolated molecular reactions. 11,23,24 An integrated approach is particularly relevant in the study of kidney disease because kidney function and its decline over time are related to many proteins and metabolites. The emerging associations from analyses of individual molecules have repeatedly implicated multiple molecules within the same pathways. 17,23,25 27 -In this study (see /uniFB02 ow chart in Supplemental Figure 1), we used a data-driven approach to identify pathways (referred to as modules) on the basis of circulating proteins and metabolites in the Chronic Renal Insuf /uniFB01 ciency Cohort (CRIC) study. 28 We /uniFB01 rst split our sample in a discovery and replication dataset to enable internal replication. We then used a dimension reduction technique called Netboost, which uses network analysis principles and has previously been shown to outperform other correlation-based approaches. 29 In this method, proteins and metabolites are organized into modules on the basis of their Spearman correlation, and the module information is then quanti /uniFB01 ed using principal component (PC) analysis. Hence, we were able to assess module-wise effects re /uniFB02 ecting the whole pathway rather than individual components and characterized these modules in terms of their relevance to kidney function decline and kidney failure.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Study Population\n\nThe purpose of the CRIC study was to examine the factors that contribute to the progression of CKD, cardiovascular disease, and overall mortality among individuals with CKD. 28 From 2003 to 2008, the CRIC study successfully recruited 3939 participants, aged 21 -74 years, with an eGFR between 20 and 70 ml/min per 1.73 m . 28 2 The study was conducted across seven clinical centers. Detailed information regarding the eligibility criteria and baseline characteristics of the cohort has been published. 28,30 In this analysis, we examined plasma samples from the year 1 visit of the CRIC study, which served as the baseline for our research. A random subsample of 1800 participants from the CRIC study was selected for metabolomic pro /uniFB01 ling; all year 1 participants with available samples underwent proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling. 31 For our study, we included individuals whose samples passed quality control assurance for both metabolomic and proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling ( N 5 1708). The /uniFB01 nal analytical cohort was split randomly into discovery (two thirds) and replication (one third) datasets.\n\n## Study Outcomes\n\nThe eGFR was calculated using the CRIC study equation, which uses both serum creatinine and cystatin C levels to estimate GFR measured by iothalamate. 32 The primary outcomes of interest in the study were time to kidney failure (de /uniFB01 ned as the need for KRT, i.e ., dialysis or transplant) and time to CKD progression (de /uniFB01 ned as the /uniFB01 rst occurrence of a decline in eGFR of $ 50% or incident kidney failure). The censoring date for follow-up was January 2019.\n\n## Proteomic Profiling\n\nWithin the CRIC study, a total of 5284 plasma protein aptamers were quanti /uniFB01 ed in the participants using the SomaScan platform v4, which uses a Slow Off-rate Modi/uniFB01 ed Aptamer-based capture array. The Adaptive Normalization by Maximum Likelihood technique used by SomaLogic was used to standardize the protein dataset, decreasing assay biases. To address the skewed distribution of raw values, the protein values were log2 transformed. In addition, any values beyond 5 SDs on the log2 scale were winsorized. Furthermore, certain aptamers were excluded from the analysis if the Bland -Altman coef /uniFB01 cient of variation exceeded 0.5 among 92 blind duplicate samples or if they were /uniFB02 agged by SomaLogic quality control. The /uniFB01 nal analysis focused exclusively on human proteins, resulting in a total of 4091 aptamers included in the study.\n\n## Metabolomic Profiling\n\nThe comprehensive procedures of the Broad Institute metabolomics methods, which encompass quality control aspects,\n\nhave been published. 31,33 In the year 1 visit plasma, a combination of three liquid chromatography -mass spectrometry injections was used to analyze metabolites. Different methods were used on the basis of the charge and polarity of the analytes. The raw metabolomics data were processed using TraceFinder (Thermo Fisher Scienti /uniFB01 c) and Progenesis QI (Nonlinear Dynamics), and metabolite peaks were identi /uniFB01 ed by comparing retention times and masses to reference mixtures and an internal database of over 600 compounds.\n\nIn the data preprocessing phase, several steps were taken to ensure the quality and suitability of the metabolite data. Samples that had more than 50% missing values across all metabolites were excluded. In addition, endogenous and unnamed metabolites that had more than 80% missing values were excluded from analysis. Imputation of missing values was performed using the minimum observed value (2.9% of metabolite values). Metabolite values were rescaled to have a median value of 1 and log2 transformed. Then, metabolites with a variance below 0.01 were removed from the analysis. Finally, to mitigate the in /uniFB02 uence of extreme values on subsequent analyses, any metabolite values that fell outside the range of 6 5 SDs from the mean were winsorized at those respective limits. The /uniFB01 nal dataset contained 630 metabolites.\n\n## Module Formation\n\nNetboost, an unsupervised three-step dimension reduction technique, was used in this study (Bioconductor R package, Netboost v2.10). 29 The process involves /uniFB01 ltering variable pairs to construct a sparse correlation-based network with strong edges. Variables are then hierarchically clustered into modules on the basis of this network, and moduleaggregated measures are quanti /uniFB01 ed using the robust PCs of each module. Netboost was used to characterize modules using combined proteomic and metabolomic data similar to a previous study on overall mortality. 24 The minimal module size was set to /uniFB01 ve, and distance measures were determined on the basis of Spearman coef /uniFB01 cients with a soft power coef /uniFB01 cient of three (default). To reduce dimensionality, highly correlated preface modules, de /uniFB01 ned as modules with a correlation of the /uniFB01 rst PCs . 0.9, were merged. Each module thus contains a unique set of proteins and metabolites. Modules were quanti /uniFB01 ed using three PCs or fewer if they already explained at least 50% of the module variance. The unsupervised Netboost procedure was /uniFB01 tted on the discovery dataset and module membership and PC loadings were transferred to the replication dataset.\n\n## Characterization of Modules and Association with Kidney Disease Progression\n\nTo characterize the identi /uniFB01 ed modules of proteins and metabolites, we regressed module PCs on various clinical traits. These traits included age, sex, eGFR, urine protein -creatinine ratio (UPCR), HDL, body mass index (BMI), serum albumin, diabetes status, and hypertension status. The UPCR was determined from a 24-hour urine collection and naturally log-transformed. Diabetes status was de /uniFB01 ned on the basis of self-reported use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications, fasting blood glucose levels $ 126 mg/dl, nonfasting blood glucose levels $ 200 mg/dl, or an HbA1c level $ 6.5%. Hypertension status was de /uniFB01 ned on the basis of self-reported antihypertensive medication use, systolic BP $ 140 mm Hg, or diastolic BP $ 90 mm Hg.\n\nSubsequently, we examined the associations between module PCs and the risk of kidney failure and CKD progression using Cox proportional hazards models. To account for potential confounders, the analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race, eGFR, ln(UPCR), HDL, serum albumin, BMI, diabetes status, and hypertension status. 34 -37 Effect sizes are reported in SD units on the basis of the discovery sample. Illustrating the bimodal distribution of a module PC, we strati /uniFB01 ed the module PC at the local minimum for the Kaplan -Meier graphs.\n\nFor each replicated module PC association, we performed the same analysis for the three proteins and three metabolites that were most strongly related to the module PCs on the basis of rank-normalized data (Spearman correlation coef /uniFB01 cient).\n\nHarrell s C-index, 38 ' as a measure of model performance, was assessed using the R package survival version 3.5 -5 39 for both clinical covariate -only models and the models incorporating both clinical covariates and module PCs. Only the independent replication set was used to assess the models ' performance and whether the module PCs improved Harrell s C-index. Replication analyses and tests ' for improvement were conducted in a one-sided manner. All other statistical tests were performed using two-sided approaches, and signi /uniFB01 cance levels were adjusted using Bonferroni correction to account for the number of module PCs tested.\n\n## Enrichment Analyses\n\nTo investigate pathways underlying the modules, we evaluated for enrichment of the metabolite super-pathways (amino acid, carbohydrate, cofactors and vitamins, lipid, nucleotide, organic acids and derivatives, organic nitrogen compounds, organoheterocyclic compounds, Xenobiotics) and subpathways using a one-tailed Fisher s exact test. In ' addition, we assessed the enrichment of proteins within the identi /uniFB01 ed module in terms of gene ontology terms. Only terms with at least three components that were measured were included in enrichment testing.\n\nEnrichment analyses were conducted using the clusterPro /uniFB01 ler R package v4.6.2. 40 To account for multiple testing, we used the Benjamini -Hochberg (BH) adjustment method, which controls the false discovery rate at a threshold of , 0.05. 41\n\n## Kidney Gene Expression Profiles\n\nTo localize gene expression within the kidney, we used the public domain data from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) as provided in the Kidney Tissue Atlas (https://atlas.kpmp.org/) 42 and extracted through the NephGen scExplorer (https://nephgen.imbi.uni-freiburg. de). We used the regional transcriptomics dataset ( N 5 36) to perform a Wilcoxon rank sum test for differences in regions (glomerulus, interstitium, thick ascending limb, collecting duct, proximal tubule, and distal convoluted tubule). The single-nucleus RNA sequencing data ( N 5 29) were used to test for differences in kidney cell subclasses. Experimental setup and cell type identi /uniFB01 cation were described by Lake et al. 42\n\nTable 1.

For each protein, we obtained all available clinical precedence for drugs targeting respective proteincoding gene. For each metabolite, we obtained all available evidence on the utilization of the respective molecule as a pharmaceutical agent.\n\n## Ethics Approval and Consent to Participate\n\nThe CRIC study obtained written informed consent from all participants and followed the ethical guidelines outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. In addition, it received approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Human samples collected as part of the KPMP consortium (https://KPMP.org) were obtained with informed consent and approved under a protocol by the KPMP single IRB of the University of Washington IRB (20190213).\n\n## Results\n\n## CRIC Study Population Characteristics\n\nThe discovery and replication samples displayed comparable distributions for all covariables included in the analysis (Table 1).\n\n## Integrated Omics Module Formation and Characterization\n\nThe 4091 proteins and 630 metabolites (Supplemental Table 1) were clustered into 139 nonoverlapping modules in the discovery data (Figure 1A). There were 154 proteins and 37 metabolites that did not cluster with sets of at least /uniFB01 ve molecules and remained unassigned. The mean module size was 32.6 proteins or metabolites; 69 modules consisted exclusively of proteins, 28 modules consisted exclusively of metabolites, and 42 modules were a combination of proteins and metabolites. There were 286 PCs used to represent the 139 modules (Methods).\n\nThe network structure was consistently recovered in the replication data (Figure 1B; Spearman correlation coef /uniFB01 cient 5 0.99, P value , 1.0 3 10 2 320 ). Modules consisting solely of metabolites or proteins displayed tighter correlation structures than mixed modules (replication sample PC1, mean Spearman correlations coef /uniFB01 cients: metabolites-only modules 5 0.81, protein-only modules 5 0.57, mixed modules 5 0.46), which aligned with the average degrees of these module types (mean degree across module types: metabolites only 5 12.0, protein only 5 26.0, mixed 5 60.3).\n\nModule PCs were related to clinical variables, demonstrating that many modules re /uniFB02 ect a speci /uniFB01 c phenotype (Supplemental Table 2). For example, 74% of the variance in the /uniFB01 rst PC of module 106 was explained by sex, which is consistent with many of the protein components being involved in sex hormone pathways ( e.g ., the luteinizing hormone and the follicle-stimulating hormone). The eGFR explained 78% of the variance of PC1 of module 15 (Figure 1C), which included creatinine and cystatin C among other proteins/metabolites that are known biomarkers of kidney /uniFB01 ltration (Supplemental Table 2), as well as more than 50% of an additional six module representations, all of which consisted of proteins and metabolites but one protein-only module. PC1 of module 15 was additionally the most strongly related module with UPCR (31% of variance explained). HDL was strongly related to module 122 -a cluster of plasmalogen metabolites (explained variance 30%). Serum albumin explained, at most, 14% of module representations.\n\n## Associations of Modules with Kidney Disease Progression\n\nThere were 537 kidney failure and 685 CKD progression events over an average follow-up of 9.5 (max. 15.5) and 7.4 (max. 15.5) years, respectively. There were 13 signi /uniFB01 cant module PC end point associations (four CKD progression; -nine kidney failure) in the discovery dataset (Table 2) in a comprehensively adjusted model ( P , 0.05/286; Methods; Supplemental Table 3) that were moved forward for replication. Twelve of the associations were direction consistent and four were validated in the replication dataset ( P , 0.05/#discovery associations, direction consistent) (Table 2): PC1 of module 15 was associated with CKD progression and kidney failure and PC2 of module 48 with CKD progression and kidney failure. All associations included adjustment for eGFR and UPCR among eight additional covariables (Methods).\n\n## Kidney Disease Progression Characterized by Transmembrane-Ephrin Receptor Activity and Amino Acid Module\n\nThe strongest association between a module and outcome was for module 15 PC1 and kidney failure (Table 2; kidney failure hazard ratio discovery 2.37 [95% con/uniFB01 dence interval, 1.69 to 3.33], replication 1.82 [95% con /uniFB01 dence interval, 1.19 to 2.79]). Module 15 included 82 metabolites and 214 proteins with a strong group\n\nFigure 1. Data-driven proteomic and metabolomic modules display a consistent network structure and relate to clinical characteristics. (A) Dendrogram of the 4091 proteins and 630 metabolites quantified in the CRIC study. In total, 139 modules (upper colored bar) were detected. Individual proteins and metabolites are depicted as the individual dendrogram leaves (lower colored bar: cyan 5 protein, red 5 metabolite), and height represents the pairwise dissimilarity of the topological overlap on the basis of the sparse correlation network. (B) Modules were detected in the discovery sample and transferred to the replication sample. The scatterplot shows the transferability of the module correlation, as expressed by the Spearman correlation coefficient of components with the PCs, from discovery to replication. The overall Spearman correlation coefficient is 0.99 ( P value , 1.0 3 10 2 320 ). The modules significantly associated with CKD progression and kidney failure are labeled (module 15: discovery 5 0.63, replication 5 0.64, module 48: discovery 5 0.48, replication 5 0.46). (C) The PC1 of module 15 displayed the strongest relation to eGFR and the strongest relation to UPCR of all module PCs.

PC1 summarized 42.7% of the variation in the 296 molecules. Central hub components of the module were NBL1, TNFRSF1A, ROR2, SELM, GM2A, and EFNA4\n\n(Spearman correlation with PC1 . 0.92). When screening the top three proteins and top three metabolites most strongly associated with module 15 PC1 (Supplemental Table 3), TNFRSF1A provided marginally stronger associations for kidney failure than the corresponding module 15\n\nTable 2.

Module 15's loadings and group effects: Local minimum of module PCs displays strong separation of incident kidney failure and CKD progression risk. (A) Loadings of module 15 components: The graph shows the contribution of each component in module 15 to PC1 and PC2. While the kidney disease-associated PC1 incorporates nine protective components, PC2 separates proteins and metabolites. Association of kidney failure (B) and progression (C) with module 15 PC1 distribution: The Kaplan-Meier graphs demonstrate the association between end points and the module PC stratified at the central local minimum in the PC1 distribution (minimum is agnostic of end point status; kidney failure log-rank P value 5 5.2 3 10 2 152 ; progression log-rank P value 5 6.2 3 10 2 148 ).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPC1 in the discovery sample ( P valueTNFRSF1A 5 2.2 3 10 2 7 , P valuem15pc1 5 5.9 3 10 2 7 ). In all other cases, the module PCs provided stronger associations (lower P values) than any of the individual molecules in discovery and replication (Supplemental Table 4).\n\nprogression (log-rank P value 5 6.2 3 10 2 148 , Figure 2C) was emphasized.\n\nNotably, only nine of 296 components translated into a protective PC1 effect for kidney failure, with all /uniFB01 ve protective proteins being transmembrane proteins (proteins: ATF6A, Alcadein a -1, ERBB1, and growth hormone receptor, C1GLC; metabolites: a 2 ketoisovalerate, myristoleate, homoarginine, and trimethylbenzene). PC2 separated the metabolomic and proteomic components of module 15 (Figure 2A). The distribution of PC1 was bimodal, and when stratifying samples by the local minimum (0.35; agnostic of case -control status), the association with kidney failure (log-rank P value 5 5.2 3 10 2 152 , Figure 2B) and\n\nThree super and subpathways were overrepresented among metabolites in module 15 (BH-adjusted P value , 0.05; Supplemental Table 5). For amino acids, carbohydrate, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and pyruvate metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and histidine metabolism, module 15 even included $ 50% of the annotated metabolites on the platform. Twelve gene ontology terms were overrepresented among proteins in module 15 (Supplemental Table 6), and transmembrane -ephrin receptor activity displayed the largest odds ratio (OR) among these (OR 5 13.2, BH P value 5 0.0047). The four ephrins in module 15 were among the core components of the disease-associated PC1, demonstrating strong correlations with PC1 (Supplemental Table 3;\n\nSpearman correlation coef /uniFB01 cient with PC1: EFNA4 5 0.92; EFNB2 5 0.91; EFNA5 5 0.91; EFNA2 5 0.89), with the /uniFB01 ve ephrin receptors also strongly related (Spearman correlation coef /uniFB01 cient with PC1: EPHB6 5 0.76; EPHA5 5 0.67; EPHB1 5 0.67; EPHB2 5 0.52; EPHA1 5 0.49).\n\n## Kidney Disease Progression Characterized by a PodocyteRelated Module\n\nModule 48 consisted of 22 proteins, and the second PC summarized 6.9% of the variation. Module 48 PC2 provided stronger statistical inference than any of the top three proteins (Supplemental Tables 3 and 4) in discovery or replication. It was furthermore signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with /uniFB01 ve patient characteristics: diabetes ( P value 5 6.78e-15), hypertension ( P value 5 2.62e-06), serum albumin ( P value 5 2.10e-18), UPCR ( P value 5 7.47e-33), and eGFR ( P value 5 2.53e-89). In kidney tissue, CRIM1 and NPNT emerged as the two encoding genes exhibiting the highest expression levels (Figure 3A). Notably, CRIM1 was identi /uniFB01 ed as the protein exhibiting the closest relationship to PC2 (Supplemental Table 3). Regional transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing show that both CRIM1 and NPNT are primarily expressed in the glomerulus ( CRIM1 : fold change 5 1.4, P value 5 7.4 3 10 2 6 ; NPNT : fold change 5 1.7, P value 5 1.3 3 10 2 3 ) and speci /uniFB01 cally in (degenerative) podocytes (Figure 3, B and C; CRIM1 : log fold change 5 2.9, P value 5 1.8 3 10 2 38 ; NPNT : log fold change 5 3.6, P value 5 1.1 3 10 2 73 ).\n\n## Risk Prediction Models for CKD Progression and Kidney Failure Improved by Podocyte-Related Module\n\nWe developed a model in the discovery dataset for each outcome consisting of the ten clinical covariates, and one model additionally adjusting for the replicated modules, and evaluated their predictive performance in the replication sample (Table 3). Discrimination of the model was signi /uniFB01 cantly better with the addition of each module for CKD progression and for module 48 PC2 for kidney failure. The highest C-statistic was achieved for the model incorporating both module PCs.\n\n## Drug Targets of Identified Components\n\nTo study the repurposing potential of the identi /uniFB01 ed pathways, we queried all components of modules 15 and 48 for ongoing and past clinical trials targeting the proteins or using the metabolites. Of the 209 unique proteins in module 15, 34 were annotated in the database (Supplemental Table 7). After exclusion of trials with status terminated or withdrawn, 160 drugs that are studied in the context of 2426 protein -drug disease combina--tions were identi /uniFB01 ed. This was driven by extensive research on some components (all with . 100 combinations: 702 EGFR, 363 VAGFA, 357 CD274, 214 MAP2K2, 147 IL2RB). Among the ephrins, an Ephrin-B2 inhibitor (CHEMBL4298079) is currently under phase 1 and 2 investigation for various cancers (bladder transitional cell carcinoma, urinary bladder carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, prostate cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, Kaposi sarcoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma). An ephrin receptor inhibitor (CHEMBL24828) was /uniFB01 rst approved as VANDETANIB in 2011 and has seven approved (all cancers) and 41 investigational indications. Of the 22 unique proteins in module 48, three were annotated (Supplemental Table 8). TFRC, TNFRSF10B, and TXN were targeted by nine unique drugs (one drug terminated in all trials). Among the 80 unique module 15 metabolites, 11 were annotated, of which seven were used in clinical trials, including two approved drugs -allopurinol and sorbitol (Supplemental Table 9).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis study aimed to explore the intricate relationship between metabolites and proteins and their association with kidney disease. Despite the importance of their myriad interactions -in their roles as substrates and enzymes, in allosteric interactions, and the assembly of protein complexes -few studies have simultaneously evaluated the proteome and metabolome. Recently, we identi /uniFB01 ed several mortality-associated modules of proteins and metabolites that related to diabetes/insulin secretion, cardiovascular disease, and kidney function. 24 In this study, we now integrated proteomic and metabolomic data into correlation-driven modules, projected them into a replication sample, investigated their association with kidney failure and CKD progression, and identi /uniFB01 ed ephrin- and podocyte-related modules that are associated with kidney disease.\n\nModule 15, the module displaying the strongest end point associations, was driven by many proteomic and metabolomic components, highlighting the utility of combining multiple sources of omics data. Enrichment analyses revealed transmembrane -ephrin receptor activity as a key driver of kidney disease progression and kidney failure. This /uniFB01 nding aligns with a previous study by Kiernan et al. 44 that implicated proteins in the ephrin superfamily with albuminuria, including a putatively causal association with EFNA4 -the most central module 15 PC1 ephrin component. Satake et al. 45 found several ephrin ligands and receptors as downstream targets of a comprehensive miRNA screen in patients with diabetic kidney disease with particularly robust independent effects for EPHA2 and EFNA4. Recently, a proteomic screen in the CRIC study with replication in ARIC also identi /uniFB01 ed the ephrin family and ephrin signaling among the top signals for a higher risk of CKD progression. 18 Early genetic studies investigated the relation of EFNB2 and kidney failure in 1071 Black patients, 46 and haplotype-based analysis reached nominal signi /uniFB01 cance ( P value 5 0.03) in the limited sample size. The ephrin-B2 receptor has been linked to kidney /uniFB01 brosis, 47 and a dedicated look-up of ephrins in our recent screen of the effects of proteins on kidney function 27 showed additional putatively causal associations for the Ephrin type A receptor 2 on albuminuria and eGFR ( P 5 6.6 3 10 2 4 , P 5 4.2 3 10 2 3 ) and for Ephrin type B receptor 1 on eGFR ( P 5 4.5 3 10 2 3 ; P , 0.05/11 ephrins). In this study, the association between the ephrin superfamily enriched module and kidney disease progression persisted even after adjusting for UPCR, indicating its independent predictive value. The analysis of drug targets revealed several ephrin-related inhibitors already under clinical investigation in the context of cancer.

In a comprehensive investigation across the proteome within the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, 15 aptamers exhibited a signi /uniFB01 cant association with eGFR decline by 50% or kidney failure. 17 Notably, 12 of the 15 aptamers were components of module 15, including NBL1, the neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1, and the most central component of this module (Spearman correlation of 0.94), which has also been independently implicated with risk of kidney failure in individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. 48 Module 15 was further enriched for members of the tryptophan pathway (enrichment OR 5 7.2; P value 5 1.8 3 10 2 3 ). Tryptophan has been highlighted in multiple previous studies using different study populations and metabolomic platforms. 21,22,49 -53 Furthermore, the link of protein and metabolite components of module 15 is supported by a recent study by Steiner et al. 54 They identi /uniFB01 ed a novel mutation of the TNFRSF1A gene, which encodes\n\nTable 3.

In the affected individuals, both the tryptophan metabolism ( P value 5 1.5 3 10 2 12 ) and histidine metabolism ( P value 5 8.9 3 10 2 6 ) were differentially regulated compared with healthy controls, coinciding with the two enriched amino acid subpathways in module 15. 54\n\nTo encompass secondary or tertiary biological functions of the data-driven pathways de /uniFB01 ning a module, we incorporated the second and third PCs for modules where the /uniFB01 rst PC explained , 50% of the variance. Indeed, module 48 PC2 showed a protective association with kidney failure and CKD progression. The central component protein, CRIM1, is a cell-surface, transmembrane protein that binds to a variety of growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor A. 55 Although the studied proteins were derived from circulating levels, the expression pro /uniFB01 les of proteins within module 48 in kidney tissue are interesting. The two most strongly expressed genes were CRIM1 and NPNT , both were speci /uniFB01 cally expressed extracellular matrix proteins in podocytes, 56 and the glomerular disease -relevant micro-RNA miR-378a-3p may target both NPNT and vascular endothelial growth factor A . 57 An quantitative UPCR study localized CRIM1 in the slit diaphragm of glomerular podocytes, 58 and immunolocalization and in situ hybridization studies in mouse kidneys demonstrated podocyte production of NPNT and deposition into the glomerular basement membrane. 59\n\nA Crim1 hypomorphic transgenic mouse developed glomerular cysts and severe glomerular vascular defects, followed by glomerular capillary defects, reduced GFR, and progressive interstitial /uniFB01 brosis. 60 Furthermore, a decrease in the NPNT expression level in zebra /uniFB01 sh induced podocyte injury. 57 A genomewide association study in Australian Aboriginal populations identi /uniFB01 ed a signi /uniFB01 cant association at CRIM1 for the albumin-to-creatinine ratio. 61,62 Taken together, these /uniFB01 ndings highlight a potential role for CRIM1 and NPNT in glomerular basement membrane and endothelial maintenance and integrity with relevance to disease progression.\n\nAnother notable /uniFB01 nding was the stability of the proteomic and metabolomic network structure. The modules identi /uniFB01 ed in the discovery set showed near-identical correlation structures in the replication data. Modules formed with metabolites alone had the strongest intranetwork correlations, suggesting strong master regulation and the potential utility of a clustering approach to the evaluation of metabolite -outcome associations. Interestingly, different types of modules (metabolite-only versus protein-only versus mixed proteins and metabolites) showed different in /uniFB02 uences of clinical characteristics. Among nine clinical characteristics, six (eGFR, UPCR, serum albumin, age, BMI, and hypertension) exerted the largest explained variance in relation to a mixed module, emphasizing the utility of the integrated analytical approach. For HDL, a speci /uniFB01 c plasmalogen metabolite module displayed the strongest characterization, and for sex and diabetes status, two protein-only modules were the top associations.\n\nThe study s major strengths included the use of network ' methods to integrate proteins and metabolites, the welldesigned CRIC cohort with long follow-up, and extensive metabolomics and proteomics panels. In addition, we used an internal replication design to validate our /uniFB01 ndings. The use of unsupervised rank-based network abstraction helped identify data-driven pathways and reduce the burden of multiple testing and presents a complementary view on kidney pathophysiology to analyses of individual molecules. However, the study also had some limitations. The used Netboost approach, like other correlation-based methods, does not establish causal relationships between variables. Module membership might be confounded by external in /uniFB02 uences, where the observed associations might be downstream of a common cause. While our analytic design is inherently associative and does not resolve causal directions, the stability of the network structure observed in the independent replication sample speaks to the robustness of the approach to generate physiological hypotheses at the pathway level that go beyond what is observed with a one-molecule-at-a-time approach. Because these conclusions are related to the comprehensive but costly combination of the SomaScan proteomics and Broad Institute metabolomics platforms, the study relied on internal replication, and the improvements in risk prediction were modest; our study is not intended to establish new clinical routines, but rather to provide insight into the pathophysiology of disease progression.\n\nIn conclusion, this study successfully demonstrated that the integration of the proteome and metabolome can identify molecules related to CKD progression. The clustering technique used sheds light on the combined effects of correlated proteins and metabolites on adverse health outcomes, complementing established risk factors. Ephrin transmembrane proteins and the podocyte-expressed CRIM1 and NPNT emerged as central components driving the observed associations and warrant further experimental and clinical investigation.\n\n## Disclosures\n\nDisclosure forms, as provided by each author, are available with the online version of the article at http://links.lww.com/ JSN/E629.\n\n## Funding\n\nFunding for the CRIC study was obtained under a cooperative agreement from National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (U01DK060990, U01DK060984, U01DK061022, U01DK061021, U01DK061028, U01DK060980, U01DK060963, U01DK060902, and U24DK060990).

Proteins and metabolites were integrated using an unsupervised clustering method, and we assessed associations between clusters and CKD progression and kidney failure using Cox proportional hazards models. Analyses were adjusted for demographics and risk factors, including the eGFR and urine protein -creatinine ratio. Associations were identi /uniFB01 ed in a discovery sample (random two thirds, n 5 1139) and then evaluated in a replication sample (one third, n 5 569).\n\nResults We identi /uniFB01 ed 139 modules of correlated proteins and metabolites, which were represented by their principal components. Modules and principal component loadings were projected onto the replication sample, which demonstrated a consistent network structure. Two modules, representing a total of 236 proteins and 82 metabolites, were robustly associated with both CKD progression and kidney failure in both discovery and validation samples. Using gene set enrichment, several transmembrane-related terms were identi /uniFB01 ed as overrepresented in these modules. Transmembrane -ephrin receptor activity displayed the largest odds (odds ratio 5 13.2, P value 5 5.5 3 10 2 5 ). A module containing CRIM1 and NPNT expressed in podocytes demonstrated particularly strong associations with kidney failure ( P value 5 2.6 3 10 2 5 ).\n\nConclusions This study demonstrates that integration of the proteome and metabolome can identify functions of pathophysiologic importance in kidney disease.\n\nJASN 35: 923 -935, 2024. doi: https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.0000000000000343\n\nThis is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

This condition is associated with a heightened risk of various medical complications, including cardiovascular disease, bone and metabolic disorders, and frailty. 1 3 -A better understanding of the intricate relationship between the human proteome and metabolome in CKD may facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers for early-stage risk prediction and shed light on underlying pathways, potentially illuminating new targets for personalized treatment\n\nDue to the number of contributing authors, the affiliations are listed at the end of this article.\n\nCorrespondence: Dr. Pascal Schlosser, email: pascal.schlosser@uniklinik-freiburg.de\n\nReceived: December 6, 2023 Accepted: April 1, 2024 Published Online Ahead of Print: April 19, 2024\n\napproaches that enhance the management of CKD and kidney failure. 4\n\nThe human proteome and metabolome are interconnected, and these connections are vital for the proper functioning of the body. Together, they represent the summative effects of genes, environment, age, comorbidities, behaviors, and medications on overall health. 5,6 Proteins serve many biological roles, including as enzymes and molecular transporters. Metabolites, which represent intermediates or end-products of these protein-driven reactions, play a central role in energy generation and maintenance of a stable internal environment (homeostasis). Metabolites are also derived from external exposures such as diet or the gut microbiome. Both protein and metabolite concentrations are tightly regulated at various steps, including production, transport between different compartments, breakdown, and excretion. 7 10 -When examining comprehensive pro /uniFB01 les of circulating metabolites and proteins, it is evident that many of them are highly correlated. 11,12\n\nStudies in CKD to date have focused on proteins or metabolites separately. Several proteomic analyses have highlighted the association of the TNF signaling pathway with the progression of kidney disease in various cohorts, with particular emphasis on TNF receptor superfamily members 1a (TNFRSF1A) and TNFRSF1B. 13 15 -Furthermore, researchers identi /uniFB01 ed a signature of circulating proteins involved in in /uniFB02 ammation that was associated with the subsequent development of kidney failure. 16 In recent comprehensive screens, Grams et al. 17 and Dubin et al. 18 studied . 4500 proteins each across three cohorts and identi /uniFB01 ed dozens of distinct proteins associated with the risk of kidney function decline. Rhee et al. 19 identi /uniFB01 ed 16 metabolites that predicted incident CKD in the Framingham Heart Study, and Sekula et al. 20 identi /uniFB01 ed metabolomic markers of eGFR, incident CKD, and incident kidney failure. Wen et al. 21 in a metabolomic analysis highlighted potential markers of glomerular /uniFB01 ltration, carbamylation, and tubular function that were associated with CKD progression in three different cohorts. Similarly, Steinbrenner et al. 22 discovered eight metabolites whose concentrations in urine were found to be associated with kidney failure.\n\nTo better understand the early changes in disease processes, an integrated assessment of metabolomic and proteomic platforms together allows for an investigation of altered pathways rather than isolated molecular reactions. 11,23,24 An integrated approach is particularly relevant in the study of kidney disease because kidney function and its decline over time are related to many proteins and metabolites. The emerging associations from analyses of individual molecules have repeatedly implicated multiple molecules within the same pathways. 17,23,25 27 -In this study (see /uniFB02 ow chart in Supplemental Figure 1), we used a data-driven approach to identify pathways (referred to as modules) on the basis of circulating proteins and metabolites in the Chronic Renal Insuf /uniFB01 ciency Cohort (CRIC) study. 28 We /uniFB01 rst split our sample in a discovery and replication dataset to enable internal replication. We then used a dimension reduction technique called Netboost, which uses network analysis principles and has previously been shown to outperform other correlation-based approaches. 29 In this method, proteins and metabolites are organized into modules on the basis of their Spearman correlation, and the module information is then quanti /uniFB01 ed using principal component (PC) analysis. Hence, we were able to assess module-wise effects re /uniFB02 ecting the whole pathway rather than individual components and characterized these modules in terms of their relevance to kidney function decline and kidney failure.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Study Population\n\nThe purpose of the CRIC study was to examine the factors that contribute to the progression of CKD, cardiovascular disease, and overall mortality among individuals with CKD. 28 From 2003 to 2008, the CRIC study successfully recruited 3939 participants, aged 21 -74 years, with an eGFR between 20 and 70 ml/min per 1.73 m . 28 2 The study was conducted across seven clinical centers. Detailed information regarding the eligibility criteria and baseline characteristics of the cohort has been published. 28,30 In this analysis, we examined plasma samples from the year 1 visit of the CRIC study, which served as the baseline for our research. A random subsample of 1800 participants from the CRIC study was selected for metabolomic pro /uniFB01 ling; all year 1 participants with available samples underwent proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling. 31 For our study, we included individuals whose samples passed quality control assurance for both metabolomic and proteomic pro /uniFB01 ling ( N 5 1708). The /uniFB01 nal analytical cohort was split randomly into discovery (two thirds) and replication (one third) datasets.\n\n## Study Outcomes\n\nThe eGFR was calculated using the CRIC study equation, which uses both serum creatinine and cystatin C levels to estimate GFR measured by iothalamate. 32 The primary outcomes of interest in the study were time to kidney failure (de /uniFB01 ned as the need for KRT, i.e ., dialysis or transplant) and time to CKD progression (de /uniFB01 ned as the /uniFB01 rst occurrence of a decline in eGFR of $ 50% or incident kidney failure). The censoring date for follow-up was January 2019.\n\n## Proteomic Profiling\n\nWithin the CRIC study, a total of 5284 plasma protein aptamers were quanti /uniFB01 ed in the participants using the SomaScan platform v4, which uses a Slow Off-rate Modi/uniFB01 ed Aptamer-based capture array. The Adaptive Normalization by Maximum Likelihood technique used by SomaLogic was used to standardize the protein dataset, decreasing assay biases. To address the skewed distribution of raw values, the protein values were log2 transformed. In addition, any values beyond 5 SDs on the log2 scale were winsorized. Furthermore, certain aptamers were excluded from the analysis if the Bland -Altman coef /uniFB01 cient of variation exceeded 0.5 among 92 blind duplicate samples or if they were /uniFB02 agged by SomaLogic quality control. The /uniFB01 nal analysis focused exclusively on human proteins, resulting in a total of 4091 aptamers included in the study.\n\n## Metabolomic Profiling\n\nThe comprehensive procedures of the Broad Institute metabolomics methods, which encompass quality control aspects,\n\nhave been published. 31,33 In the year 1 visit plasma, a combination of three liquid chromatography -mass spectrometry injections was used to analyze metabolites. Different methods were used on the basis of the charge and polarity of the analytes. The raw metabolomics data were processed using TraceFinder (Thermo Fisher Scienti /uniFB01 c) and Progenesis QI (Nonlinear Dynamics), and metabolite peaks were identi /uniFB01 ed by comparing retention times and masses to reference mixtures and an internal database of over 600 compounds.\n\nIn the data preprocessing phase, several steps were taken to ensure the quality and suitability of the metabolite data. Samples that had more than 50% missing values across all metabolites were excluded. In addition, endogenous and unnamed metabolites that had more than 80% missing values were excluded from analysis. Imputation of missing values was performed using the minimum observed value (2.9% of metabolite values). Metabolite values were rescaled to have a median value of 1 and log2 transformed. Then, metabolites with a variance below 0.01 were removed from the analysis. Finally, to mitigate the in /uniFB02 uence of extreme values on subsequent analyses, any metabolite values that fell outside the range of 6 5 SDs from the mean were winsorized at those respective limits. The /uniFB01 nal dataset contained 630 metabolites.\n\n## Module Formation\n\nNetboost, an unsupervised three-step dimension reduction technique, was used in this study (Bioconductor R package, Netboost v2.10). 29 The process involves /uniFB01 ltering variable pairs to construct a sparse correlation-based network with strong edges. Variables are then hierarchically clustered into modules on the basis of this network, and moduleaggregated measures are quanti /uniFB01 ed using the robust PCs of each module. Netboost was used to characterize modules using combined proteomic and metabolomic data similar to a previous study on overall mortality. 24 The minimal module size was set to /uniFB01 ve, and distance measures were determined on the basis of Spearman coef /uniFB01 cients with a soft power coef /uniFB01 cient of three (default). To reduce dimensionality, highly correlated preface modules, de /uniFB01 ned as modules with a correlation of the /uniFB01 rst PCs . 0.9, were merged. Each module thus contains a unique set of proteins and metabolites. Modules were quanti /uniFB01 ed using three PCs or fewer if they already explained at least 50% of the module variance. The unsupervised Netboost procedure was /uniFB01 tted on the discovery dataset and module membership and PC loadings were transferred to the replication dataset.\n\n## Characterization of Modules and Association with Kidney Disease Progression\n\nTo characterize the identi /uniFB01 ed modules of proteins and metabolites, we regressed module PCs on various clinical traits. These traits included age, sex, eGFR, urine protein -creatinine ratio (UPCR), HDL, body mass index (BMI), serum albumin, diabetes status, and hypertension status. The UPCR was determined from a 24-hour urine collection and naturally log-transformed. Diabetes status was de /uniFB01 ned on the basis of self-reported use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications, fasting blood glucose levels $ 126 mg/dl, nonfasting blood glucose levels $ 200 mg/dl, or an HbA1c level $ 6.5%. Hypertension status was de /uniFB01 ned on the basis of self-reported antihypertensive medication use, systolic BP $ 140 mm Hg, or diastolic BP $ 90 mm Hg.\n\nSubsequently, we examined the associations between module PCs and the risk of kidney failure and CKD progression using Cox proportional hazards models. To account for potential confounders, the analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race, eGFR, ln(UPCR), HDL, serum albumin, BMI, diabetes status, and hypertension status. 34 -37 Effect sizes are reported in SD units on the basis of the discovery sample. Illustrating the bimodal distribution of a module PC, we strati /uniFB01 ed the module PC at the local minimum for the Kaplan -Meier graphs.\n\nFor each replicated module PC association, we performed the same analysis for the three proteins and three metabolites that were most strongly related to the module PCs on the basis of rank-normalized data (Spearman correlation coef /uniFB01 cient).\n\nHarrell s C-index, 38 ' as a measure of model performance, was assessed using the R package survival version 3.5 -5 39 for both clinical covariate -only models and the models incorporating both clinical covariates and module PCs. Only the independent replication set was used to assess the models ' performance and whether the module PCs improved Harrell s C-index. Replication analyses and tests ' for improvement were conducted in a one-sided manner. All other statistical tests were performed using two-sided approaches, and signi /uniFB01 cance levels were adjusted using Bonferroni correction to account for the number of module PCs tested.\n\n## Enrichment Analyses\n\nTo investigate pathways underlying the modules, we evaluated for enrichment of the metabolite super-pathways (amino acid, carbohydrate, cofactors and vitamins, lipid, nucleotide, organic acids and derivatives, organic nitrogen compounds, organoheterocyclic compounds, Xenobiotics) and subpathways using a one-tailed Fisher s exact test. In ' addition, we assessed the enrichment of proteins within the identi /uniFB01 ed module in terms of gene ontology terms. Only terms with at least three components that were measured were included in enrichment testing.\n\nEnrichment analyses were conducted using the clusterPro /uniFB01 ler R package v4.6.2. 40 To account for multiple testing, we used the Benjamini -Hochberg (BH) adjustment method, which controls the false discovery rate at a threshold of , 0.05. 41\n\n## Kidney Gene Expression Profiles\n\nTo localize gene expression within the kidney, we used the public domain data from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) as provided in the Kidney Tissue Atlas (https://atlas.kpmp.org/) 42 and extracted through the NephGen scExplorer (https://nephgen.imbi.uni-freiburg. de). We used the regional transcriptomics dataset ( N 5 36) to perform a Wilcoxon rank sum test for differences in regions (glomerulus, interstitium, thick ascending limb, collecting duct, proximal tubule, and distal convoluted tubule). The single-nucleus RNA sequencing data ( N 5 29) were used to test for differences in kidney cell subclasses. Experimental setup and cell type identi /uniFB01 cation were described by Lake et al. 42\n\nTable 1.

For each protein, we obtained all available clinical precedence for drugs targeting respective proteincoding gene. For each metabolite, we obtained all available evidence on the utilization of the respective molecule as a pharmaceutical agent.\n\n## Ethics Approval and Consent to Participate\n\nThe CRIC study obtained written informed consent from all participants and followed the ethical guidelines outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. In addition, it received approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Human samples collected as part of the KPMP consortium (https://KPMP.org) were obtained with informed consent and approved under a protocol by the KPMP single IRB of the University of Washington IRB (20190213).\n\n## Results\n\n## CRIC Study Population Characteristics\n\nThe discovery and replication samples displayed comparable distributions for all covariables included in the analysis (Table 1).\n\n## Integrated Omics Module Formation and Characterization\n\nThe 4091 proteins and 630 metabolites (Supplemental Table 1) were clustered into 139 nonoverlapping modules in the discovery data (Figure 1A). There were 154 proteins and 37 metabolites that did not cluster with sets of at least /uniFB01 ve molecules and remained unassigned. The mean module size was 32.6 proteins or metabolites; 69 modules consisted exclusively of proteins, 28 modules consisted exclusively of metabolites, and 42 modules were a combination of proteins and metabolites. There were 286 PCs used to represent the 139 modules (Methods).\n\nThe network structure was consistently recovered in the replication data (Figure 1B; Spearman correlation coef /uniFB01 cient 5 0.99, P value , 1.0 3 10 2 320 ). Modules consisting solely of metabolites or proteins displayed tighter correlation structures than mixed modules (replication sample PC1, mean Spearman correlations coef /uniFB01 cients: metabolites-only modules 5 0.81, protein-only modules 5 0.57, mixed modules 5 0.46), which aligned with the average degrees of these module types (mean degree across module types: metabolites only 5 12.0, protein only 5 26.0, mixed 5 60.3).\n\nModule PCs were related to clinical variables, demonstrating that many modules re /uniFB02 ect a speci /uniFB01 c phenotype (Supplemental Table 2). For example, 74% of the variance in the /uniFB01 rst PC of module 106 was explained by sex, which is consistent with many of the protein components being involved in sex hormone pathways ( e.g ., the luteinizing hormone and the follicle-stimulating hormone). The eGFR explained 78% of the variance of PC1 of module 15 (Figure 1C), which included creatinine and cystatin C among other proteins/metabolites that are known biomarkers of kidney /uniFB01 ltration (Supplemental Table 2), as well as more than 50% of an additional six module representations, all of which consisted of proteins and metabolites but one protein-only module. PC1 of module 15 was additionally the most strongly related module with UPCR (31% of variance explained). HDL was strongly related to module 122 -a cluster of plasmalogen metabolites (explained variance 30%). Serum albumin explained, at most, 14% of module representations.\n\n## Associations of Modules with Kidney Disease Progression\n\nThere were 537 kidney failure and 685 CKD progression events over an average follow-up of 9.5 (max. 15.5) and 7.4 (max. 15.5) years, respectively. There were 13 signi /uniFB01 cant module PC end point associations (four CKD progression; -nine kidney failure) in the discovery dataset (Table 2) in a comprehensively adjusted model ( P , 0.05/286; Methods; Supplemental Table 3) that were moved forward for replication. Twelve of the associations were direction consistent and four were validated in the replication dataset ( P , 0.05/#discovery associations, direction consistent) (Table 2): PC1 of module 15 was associated with CKD progression and kidney failure and PC2 of module 48 with CKD progression and kidney failure. All associations included adjustment for eGFR and UPCR among eight additional covariables (Methods).\n\n## Kidney Disease Progression Characterized by Transmembrane-Ephrin Receptor Activity and Amino Acid Module\n\nThe strongest association between a module and outcome was for module 15 PC1 and kidney failure (Table 2; kidney failure hazard ratio discovery 2.37 [95% con/uniFB01 dence interval, 1.69 to 3.33], replication 1.82 [95% con /uniFB01 dence interval, 1.19 to 2.79]). Module 15 included 82 metabolites and 214 proteins with a strong group\n\nFigure 1. Data-driven proteomic and metabolomic modules display a consistent network structure and relate to clinical characteristics. (A) Dendrogram of the 4091 proteins and 630 metabolites quantified in the CRIC study. In total, 139 modules (upper colored bar) were detected. Individual proteins and metabolites are depicted as the individual dendrogram leaves (lower colored bar: cyan 5 protein, red 5 metabolite), and height represents the pairwise dissimilarity of the topological overlap on the basis of the sparse correlation network. (B) Modules were detected in the discovery sample and transferred to the replication sample. The scatterplot shows the transferability of the module correlation, as expressed by the Spearman correlation coefficient of components with the PCs, from discovery to replication. The overall Spearman correlation coefficient is 0.99 ( P value , 1.0 3 10 2 320 ). The modules significantly associated with CKD progression and kidney failure are labeled (module 15: discovery 5 0.63, replication 5 0.64, module 48: discovery 5 0.48, replication 5 0.46). (C) The PC1 of module 15 displayed the strongest relation to eGFR and the strongest relation to UPCR of all module PCs.

PC1 summarized 42.7% of the variation in the 296 molecules. Central hub components of the module were NBL1, TNFRSF1A, ROR2, SELM, GM2A, and EFNA4\n\n(Spearman correlation with PC1 . 0.92). When screening the top three proteins and top three metabolites most strongly associated with module 15 PC1 (Supplemental Table 3), TNFRSF1A provided marginally stronger associations for kidney failure than the corresponding module 15\n\nTable 2.

Association of kidney failure (B) and progression (C) with module 15 PC1 distribution: The Kaplan-Meier graphs demonstrate the association between end points and the module PC stratified at the central local minimum in the PC1 distribution (minimum is agnostic of end point status; kidney failure log-rank P value 5 5.2 3 10 2 152 ; progression log-rank P value 5 6.2 3 10 2 148 ).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPC1 in the discovery sample ( P valueTNFRSF1A 5 2.2 3 10 2 7 , P valuem15pc1 5 5.9 3 10 2 7 ). In all other cases, the module PCs provided stronger associations (lower P values) than any of the individual molecules in discovery and replication (Supplemental Table 4).\n\nprogression (log-rank P value 5 6.2 3 10 2 148 , Figure 2C) was emphasized.\n\nNotably, only nine of 296 components translated into a protective PC1 effect for kidney failure, with all /uniFB01 ve protective proteins being transmembrane proteins (proteins: ATF6A, Alcadein a -1, ERBB1, and growth hormone receptor, C1GLC; metabolites: a 2 ketoisovalerate, myristoleate, homoarginine, and trimethylbenzene). PC2 separated the metabolomic and proteomic components of module 15 (Figure 2A). The distribution of PC1 was bimodal, and when stratifying samples by the local minimum (0.35; agnostic of case -control status), the association with kidney failure (log-rank P value 5 5.2 3 10 2 152 , Figure 2B) and\n\nThree super and subpathways were overrepresented among metabolites in module 15 (BH-adjusted P value , 0.05; Supplemental Table 5). For amino acids, carbohydrate, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and pyruvate metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and histidine metabolism, module 15 even included $ 50% of the annotated metabolites on the platform. Twelve gene ontology terms were overrepresented among proteins in module 15 (Supplemental Table 6), and transmembrane -ephrin receptor activity displayed the largest odds ratio (OR) among these (OR 5 13.2, BH P value 5 0.0047). The four ephrins in module 15 were among the core components of the disease-associated PC1, demonstrating strong correlations with PC1 (Supplemental Table 3;\n\nSpearman correlation coef /uniFB01 cient with PC1: EFNA4 5 0.92; EFNB2 5 0.91; EFNA5 5 0.91; EFNA2 5 0.89), with the /uniFB01 ve ephrin receptors also strongly related (Spearman correlation coef /uniFB01 cient with PC1: EPHB6 5 0.76; EPHA5 5 0.67; EPHB1 5 0.67; EPHB2 5 0.52; EPHA1 5 0.49).\n\n## Kidney Disease Progression Characterized by a PodocyteRelated Module\n\nModule 48 consisted of 22 proteins, and the second PC summarized 6.9% of the variation. Module 48 PC2 provided stronger statistical inference than any of the top three proteins (Supplemental Tables 3 and 4) in discovery or replication. It was furthermore signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with /uniFB01 ve patient characteristics: diabetes ( P value 5 6.78e-15), hypertension ( P value 5 2.62e-06), serum albumin ( P value 5 2.10e-18), UPCR ( P value 5 7.47e-33), and eGFR ( P value 5 2.53e-89). In kidney tissue, CRIM1 and NPNT emerged as the two encoding genes exhibiting the highest expression levels (Figure 3A). Notably, CRIM1 was identi /uniFB01 ed as the protein exhibiting the closest relationship to PC2 (Supplemental Table 3). Regional transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing show that both CRIM1 and NPNT are primarily expressed in the glomerulus ( CRIM1 : fold change 5 1.4, P value 5 7.4 3 10 2 6 ; NPNT : fold change 5 1.7, P value 5 1.3 3 10 2 3 ) and speci /uniFB01 cally in (degenerative) podocytes (Figure 3, B and C; CRIM1 : log fold change 5 2.9, P value 5 1.8 3 10 2 38 ; NPNT : log fold change 5 3.6, P value 5 1.1 3 10 2 73 ).\n\n## Risk Prediction Models for CKD Progression and Kidney Failure Improved by Podocyte-Related Module\n\nWe developed a model in the discovery dataset for each outcome consisting of the ten clinical covariates, and one model additionally adjusting for the replicated modules, and evaluated their predictive performance in the replication sample (Table 3). Discrimination of the model was signi /uniFB01 cantly better with the addition of each module for CKD progression and for module 48 PC2 for kidney failure. The highest C-statistic was achieved for the model incorporating both module PCs.\n\n## Drug Targets of Identified Components\n\nTo study the repurposing potential of the identi /uniFB01 ed pathways, we queried all components of modules 15 and 48 for ongoing and past clinical trials targeting the proteins or using the metabolites. Of the 209 unique proteins in module 15, 34 were annotated in the database (Supplemental Table 7). After exclusion of trials with status terminated or withdrawn, 160 drugs that are studied in the context of 2426 protein -drug disease combina--tions were identi /uniFB01 ed. This was driven by extensive research on some components (all with . 100 combinations: 702 EGFR, 363 VAGFA, 357 CD274, 214 MAP2K2, 147 IL2RB). Among the ephrins, an Ephrin-B2 inhibitor (CHEMBL4298079) is currently under phase 1 and 2 investigation for various cancers (bladder transitional cell carcinoma, urinary bladder carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, prostate cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, Kaposi sarcoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma). An ephrin receptor inhibitor (CHEMBL24828) was /uniFB01 rst approved as VANDETANIB in 2011 and has seven approved (all cancers) and 41 investigational indications. Of the 22 unique proteins in module 48, three were annotated (Supplemental Table 8). TFRC, TNFRSF10B, and TXN were targeted by nine unique drugs (one drug terminated in all trials). Among the 80 unique module 15 metabolites, 11 were annotated, of which seven were used in clinical trials, including two approved drugs -allopurinol and sorbitol (Supplemental Table 9).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis study aimed to explore the intricate relationship between metabolites and proteins and their association with kidney disease. Despite the importance of their myriad interactions -in their roles as substrates and enzymes, in allosteric interactions, and the assembly of protein complexes -few studies have simultaneously evaluated the proteome and metabolome. Recently, we identi /uniFB01 ed several mortality-associated modules of proteins and metabolites that related to diabetes/insulin secretion, cardiovascular disease, and kidney function. 24 In this study, we now integrated proteomic and metabolomic data into correlation-driven modules, projected them into a replication sample, investigated their association with kidney failure and CKD progression, and identi /uniFB01 ed ephrin- and podocyte-related modules that are associated with kidney disease.\n\nModule 15, the module displaying the strongest end point associations, was driven by many proteomic and metabolomic components, highlighting the utility of combining multiple sources of omics data. Enrichment analyses revealed transmembrane -ephrin receptor activity as a key driver of kidney disease progression and kidney failure. This /uniFB01 nding aligns with a previous study by Kiernan et al. 44 that implicated proteins in the ephrin superfamily with albuminuria, including a putatively causal association with EFNA4 -the most central module 15 PC1 ephrin component. Satake et al. 45 found several ephrin ligands and receptors as downstream targets of a comprehensive miRNA screen in patients with diabetic kidney disease with particularly robust independent effects for EPHA2 and EFNA4. Recently, a proteomic screen in the CRIC study with replication in ARIC also identi /uniFB01 ed the ephrin family and ephrin signaling among the top signals for a higher risk of CKD progression. 18 Early genetic studies investigated the relation of EFNB2 and kidney failure in 1071 Black patients, 46 and haplotype-based analysis reached nominal signi /uniFB01 cance ( P value 5 0.03) in the limited sample size. The ephrin-B2 receptor has been linked to kidney /uniFB01 brosis, 47 and a dedicated look-up of ephrins in our recent screen of the effects of proteins on kidney function 27 showed additional putatively causal associations for the Ephrin type A receptor 2 on albuminuria and eGFR ( P 5 6.6 3 10 2 4 , P 5 4.2 3 10 2 3 ) and for Ephrin type B receptor 1 on eGFR ( P 5 4.5 3 10 2 3 ; P , 0.05/11 ephrins). In this study, the association between the ephrin superfamily enriched module and kidney disease progression persisted even after adjusting for UPCR, indicating its independent predictive value. The analysis of drug targets revealed several ephrin-related inhibitors already under clinical investigation in the context of cancer.

In a comprehensive investigation across the proteome within the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, 15 aptamers exhibited a signi /uniFB01 cant association with eGFR decline by 50% or kidney failure. 17 Notably, 12 of the 15 aptamers were components of module 15, including NBL1, the neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1, and the most central component of this module (Spearman correlation of 0.94), which has also been independently implicated with risk of kidney failure in individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. 48 Module 15 was further enriched for members of the tryptophan pathway (enrichment OR 5 7.2; P value 5 1.8 3 10 2 3 ). Tryptophan has been highlighted in multiple previous studies using different study populations and metabolomic platforms. 21,22,49 -53 Furthermore, the link of protein and metabolite components of module 15 is supported by a recent study by Steiner et al. 54 They identi /uniFB01 ed a novel mutation of the TNFRSF1A gene, which encodes\n\nTable 3.

In the affected individuals, both the tryptophan metabolism ( P value 5 1.5 3 10 2 12 ) and histidine metabolism ( P value 5 8.9 3 10 2 6 ) were differentially regulated compared with healthy controls, coinciding with the two enriched amino acid subpathways in module 15. 54\n\nTo encompass secondary or tertiary biological functions of the data-driven pathways de /uniFB01 ning a module, we incorporated the second and third PCs for modules where the /uniFB01 rst PC explained , 50% of the variance. Indeed, module 48 PC2 showed a protective association with kidney failure and CKD progression. The central component protein, CRIM1, is a cell-surface, transmembrane protein that binds to a variety of growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor A. 55 Although the studied proteins were derived from circulating levels, the expression pro /uniFB01 les of proteins within module 48 in kidney tissue are interesting. The two most strongly expressed genes were CRIM1 and NPNT , both were speci /uniFB01 cally expressed extracellular matrix proteins in podocytes, 56 and the glomerular disease -relevant micro-RNA miR-378a-3p may target both NPNT and vascular endothelial growth factor A . 57 An quantitative UPCR study localized CRIM1 in the slit diaphragm of glomerular podocytes, 58 and immunolocalization and in situ hybridization studies in mouse kidneys demonstrated podocyte production of NPNT and deposition into the glomerular basement membrane. 59\n\nA Crim1 hypomorphic transgenic mouse developed glomerular cysts and severe glomerular vascular defects, followed by glomerular capillary defects, reduced GFR, and progressive interstitial /uniFB01 brosis. 60 Furthermore, a decrease in the NPNT expression level in zebra /uniFB01 sh induced podocyte injury. 57 A genomewide association study in Australian Aboriginal populations identi /uniFB01 ed a signi /uniFB01 cant association at CRIM1 for the albumin-to-creatinine ratio. 61,62 Taken together, these /uniFB01 ndings highlight a potential role for CRIM1 and NPNT in glomerular basement membrane and endothelial maintenance and integrity with relevance to disease progression.\n\nAnother notable /uniFB01 nding was the stability of the proteomic and metabolomic network structure. The modules identi /uniFB01 ed in the discovery set showed near-identical correlation structures in the replication data. Modules formed with metabolites alone had the strongest intranetwork correlations, suggesting strong master regulation and the potential utility of a clustering approach to the evaluation of metabolite -outcome associations. Interestingly, different types of modules (metabolite-only versus protein-only versus mixed proteins and metabolites) showed different in /uniFB02 uences of clinical characteristics. Among nine clinical characteristics, six (eGFR, UPCR, serum albumin, age, BMI, and hypertension) exerted the largest explained variance in relation to a mixed module, emphasizing the utility of the integrated analytical approach. For HDL, a speci /uniFB01 c plasmalogen metabolite module displayed the strongest characterization, and for sex and diabetes status, two protein-only modules were the top associations.\n\nThe study s major strengths included the use of network ' methods to integrate proteins and metabolites, the welldesigned CRIC cohort with long follow-up, and extensive metabolomics and proteomics panels. In addition, we used an internal replication design to validate our /uniFB01 ndings. The use of unsupervised rank-based network abstraction helped identify data-driven pathways and reduce the burden of multiple testing and presents a complementary view on kidney pathophysiology to analyses of individual molecules. However, the study also had some limitations. The used Netboost approach, like other correlation-based methods, does not establish causal relationships between variables. Module membership might be confounded by external in /uniFB02 uences, where the observed associations might be downstream of a common cause. While our analytic design is inherently associative and does not resolve causal directions, the stability of the network structure observed in the independent replication sample speaks to the robustness of the approach to generate physiological hypotheses at the pathway level that go beyond what is observed with a one-molecule-at-a-time approach. Because these conclusions are related to the comprehensive but costly combination of the SomaScan proteomics and Broad Institute metabolomics platforms, the study relied on internal replication, and the improvements in risk prediction were modest; our study is not intended to establish new clinical routines, but rather to provide insight into the pathophysiology of disease progression.\n\nIn conclusion, this study successfully demonstrated that the integration of the proteome and metabolome can identify molecules related to CKD progression. The clustering technique used sheds light on the combined effects of correlated proteins and metabolites on adverse health outcomes, complementing established risk factors. Ephrin transmembrane proteins and the podocyte-expressed CRIM1 and NPNT emerged as central components driving the observed associations and warrant further experimental and clinical investigation.\n\n## Disclosures\n\nDisclosure forms, as provided by each author, are available with the online version of the article at http://links.lww.com/ JSN/E629.\n\n## Funding\n\nFunding for the CRIC study was obtained under a cooperative agreement from National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (U01DK060990, U01DK060984, U01DK061022, U01DK061021, U01DK061028, U01DK060980, U01DK060963, U01DK060902, and U24DK060990).
